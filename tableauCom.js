<tr><td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td><td>161936</td>
<td>1</td><td>England</td><td>Three things: 1. I love Pandemic 2. I love Legacy games where the game state changes across plays 3. I'm not concerned that you can't play again once you've finished. So why have I rated this a 1? Because for me and my fellow player the game turned out to be broken. Three quaters of the way through a card was revealed that contains, with hindsight, ambiguous instructions. We followed these and ended up some plays later, in a terrible position. We were then presented with something new that made no sense so we checked the internet and discovered the card was intended to be read in another way. By this time we couldn't reasonably undo prior plays and there was no point continuing. So we abandoned it before the end with great disappointment. If we'd read the card the way it was intended I think it would have lead to an exciting conclusion. Very surprised this didn't come up in play testing, and we aren't the only ones this has happened to. So very disappointing for us. I've avoided going into any detail so as not to provide spoilers.</td></tr><tr><td>Caverna: The Cave Farmers</td><td>102794</td>
<td>1</td><td>United States</td><td>Dreadful, the absolute worst experience I've ever had with a game.  Three and a half hours of watching people stare aimlessly at a table while arranging pumpkins and small animals. I never want to hear anyone who likes this game complain about any other game causing AP. Lame theme, horrible pacing and simply way way to long.  I hope I never see this mess again.</td></tr><tr><td>Puerto Rico</td><td>3076</td>
<td>1</td><td>United States</td><td>This appears to be one of those games you either love or hate.  I'm sorry, I'm probably swimming upstream, but in the 4-5 times I've played it, I have formed an extremely negative opinion of the game.  The Turn order always messes me up.  The guy in front of me invariably takes what will screw me over or what I need the most.  I just don't get the strategy or the appeal of the game.  You could not pay me to play it.  Then there are all of the "unofficial" expansions that people are printing out and tossing into the mix that makes it even worse.  After trying to play a few more times my opinion has not changed.. in fact, I hate it more than ever. </td></tr><tr><td>Puerto Rico</td><td>3076</td>
<td>1</td><td>United States</td><td>Played it just once. Couldn't get my opponents to finish the game; it was a struggle from beginning to end trying to keep them interested. Needless to say, I will never play it again. Game is waaaaaay over-rated.</td></tr><tr><td>Blood Rage</td><td>170216</td>
<td>1</td><td>United States</td><td>This is a broken game. You win this game every time if you get all your players into the Ragnar&#246;k and lose the most battles. Winning battles is the worst thing you could do as a Viking Warrior apparently... The theme of the game does not work at all with the mechanics and scoring. I would think that the winner would be the last one standing, but what would I know.</td></tr><tr><td>Brass</td><td>28720</td>
<td>1</td><td>United States</td><td>I played this once, and I won it, so don't call me a sore loser when I say this sucks.  If it were fun, it wouldn't suck, but it lacks fun.  It lacks theme.  It's so un-fun that it's a black hole sucking the joy out of everything around it.  If you are the next table over from a group playing Brass, your game isn't going to be as fun.  Just pick up your game and move.   If you think this is "fun," you probably think Mr. Spock is a wild and crazy guy!  But you know what would make this game fun?  Dinosaurs.  If they were carrying laser guns and flying space ships, this game would be incredible.  But you see, dinosaurs do those kind of things.  Unfortunately, this game has no dinosaurs.  Maybe an expansion will take care of that deficiency.  One can only hope.</td></tr><tr><td>Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar</td><td>126163</td>
<td>1</td><td></td><td>Played it quite a few times and never could figure out how to get a decent score, even following suggestions posted on BGG. This game is ANNOYING!</td></tr><tr><td>Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game</td><td>150376</td>
<td>1</td><td></td><td>With a traitor = 5, without a traitor = 1. Nothing exceptional or unique here, a super-busy mashup of a cooperative intrigue game, tries to achieve too much and results in lots of down time. I hate the theme and the role playing aspects which are exceptionally nerdy.</td></tr><tr><td>Food Chain Magnate</td><td>175914</td>
<td>1</td><td>Indonesia</td><td>Its 2016 not 80's, do the artwork, with a plain paper a pen and a ruler even a grade6 can do that kind of artwork. Please hire an artist,there are a lot of them in the world. You allready charge way too high for the game, it won't hurt to hire an artist. Still thinking hire an artist cost too much,go to 3rd world country there are a lot of them come in cheap price.</td></tr><tr><td>Concordia</td><td>124361</td>
<td>1</td><td>United States</td><td>Like a loooong slog through thigh deep mud, only to arrive just as someone beats you to it. Which wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take several turns to set up for every move. Then you can try something else if you have the correct resources, or go on with your plan if you have the money to pay double. Cards cannot be counted on as by the time your turn rolls around it may be a completely new set and not ones you can afford or even use. Locations may favor the start players and that may or may not be mitigated by the "double prizes" for the last player. Almost no way to plan ahead. Given the random board setup and rotating cards, I would argue there is luck involved. Luck in turn order vs. board lay out and how the cards come out. Played 2 games, one 4 player and one 5 player. Won one, lost one. I don't hate Euros by any stretch, but you could not pay me to play this one again! Pure torture.   Sold at JVMA - making lemonade...</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game</td><td>103885</td>
<td>1</td><td>United States</td><td>Even though Star Wars is the stoopidest story ever told....  I thought this game might be interesting....but it's not.  I think it only works if you're dumb enough to think Star Wars is cool.   I'm not looking for realism in cardboard, but there's just no way this is representative of even the fairy tale physics of Star Wars combat.</td></tr><tr><td>Battlestar Galactica</td><td>37111</td>
<td>1</td><td>Canada</td><td>It does okay at capturing the feel of the early re-imagined series, but game play is dreadful. Too much time between turns, too many random elements that can leave a player with nothing meaningful to do. The admiral gets to make far too many decisions and the other players are bored to tears.  This is the only game I have played that if it were to hit the table again I would leave; just thinking about it elicits such incredible revulsion.</td></tr><tr><td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td><td>161936</td>
<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>I was enjoying this game, then it UNDESERVINGLY stole Twilight Struggle's throne with 1/6 of the votes (and a deliberate sabotage campaign)...  and then September happened. So in pure spite of Pandemic Legacy getting to #1, let me just say...  &#729;&#623;&#477;&#613;&#647; &#477;&#387;&#592;&#647;oq&#592;s o&#647; &#623;&#592;&#477;&#647; &#633;&#7433;&#477;&#613;&#647; uo &#633;o&#647;&#7433;&#592;&#633;&#647; &#592; p&#477;&#647;u&#592;ld pu&#592; '&#647;&#592;o&#387;&#477;d&#592;&#596;s &#596;&#7433;lqnd &#592; s&#592; &#390;p&#390; &#477;&#613;&#647; &#387;u&#7433;sn &#477;&#633;&#592; pu&#592; s&#477;&#7433;q&#623;oz p&#477;p&#592;&#607; &#592;po&#596; &#477;&#613;&#647; p&#477;&#633;&#477;&#477;u&#7433;&#387;u&#477;-o&#7433;q &#654;&#633;&#592;&#647;&#7433;l&#7433;&#623; &#477;&#613;&#9524;  Oh, did I forget to put "spoiler" in front of that? Silly me.   Maybe I'm also pissed that this game screwed us over completely in our campaign (see below). And a co-op as #1 means that inferior games will now get all the attention, as if there wasn't already a critical mass of dilettantes in the hobby who only want to play Catan, Ticket to Ride, and maybe Lords of Waterdeep if you're "lucky."    Oh, and we predicted the Big Twist way back in the May campaign game, so it was pretty lame that it wasn't more creative.   But the reason I got so pissed and decided to spoil it is because our game is now BASICALLY UNWINNABLE:    &#729;s&#7433; &#647;&#7433; s&#592; uo &#387;u&#592;&#613; o&#647; &#477;lq&#592; u&#477;&#477;q &#654;l&#477;&#633;&#592;q &#477;&#652;&#592;&#613; o&#613;&#653; s&#633;&#477;&#647;&#596;&#592;&#633;&#592;&#613;&#596; &#670;s&#7433;&#633; o&#647; s&#7433; &#647;u&#477;&#623;&#647;&#592;&#477;&#633;&#647; p&#477;p&#592;&#607; &#592; &#9524;&#398;&#1508; o&#647; &#654;&#592;&#653; &#654;luo &#477;&#613;&#647; oS &#729;&#633;&#592;&#596;s &#477;uo s&#592;&#613; &#654;p&#592;&#477;&#633;l&#592; &#647;s&#7433;l&#592;&#7433;&#596;&#477;dS &#477;u&#7433;&#647;u&#592;&#633;&#592;nQ &#477;&#613;&#647; pu&#592; '&#477;uoz &#8704;po&#390; &#477;&#613;&#647; o&#647;u&#7433; oq&#623;o&#596; &#647;s&#7433;&#647;u&#477;&#7433;&#596;S/&#633;&#477;&#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;s&#477;&#633; &#633;no &#387;u&#7433;pu&#477;s &#477;&#653; &#633;no ll&#477;&#613; u&#7433; &#654;&#592;&#653; oN &#729;&#654;l&#647;u&#477;&#7433;&#596;&#7433;&#607;&#607;&#477; &#477;uop &#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;S &#477;&#613;&#647; &#647;&#477;&#387; plno&#596; &#477;&#653; os llnd-&#477;&#633; o&#647; &#633;&#477;&#7433;ploS &#477;&#613;&#647; &#633;o&#607; sp&#633;&#592;&#596; p&#477;dd&#7433;nb&#477; &#654;ll&#592;&#596;&#7433;&#607;&#7433;&#596;&#477;ds p&#592;&#613; &#477;&#653; pN&#8704; 'snuoq &#654;&#633;&#592;&#647;&#7433;l&#7433;&#623; &#406;+ &#477;&#613;&#647; &#387;u&#7433;sol &#477;&#633;,&#477;&#653; &#477;&#596;u&#7433;s '&#477;&#633;o&#623;&#654;u&#592; &#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;S &#477;&#647;&#477;ld&#623;o&#596; o&#647; &#654;&#592;&#653; poo&#387; ou s,&#477;&#633;&#477;&#613;&#9524; -   &#729;&#647;&#7433; &#647;n&#596; o&#647; &#387;u&#7433;o&#387; &#647;,us&#7433; &#647;&#7433; &#647;nq &#477;&#623;&#592;&#387; &#647;s&#592;l &#633;no u&#7433; s&#477;&#7433;&#647;&#7433;&#596; u&#477;ll&#592;&#607;/&#387;u&#7433;sd&#592;llo&#596; &#4357; &#477;&#613;&#647; puno&#633;&#592; dn s&#670;&#596;olqp&#592;o&#633; &#647;u&#477;u&#592;&#623;&#633;&#477;d &#477;&#623;os &#647;o&#387; &#477;M &#729;&#613;&#647;uo&#623; &#647;x&#477;u &#477;sd&#592;llo&#596; o&#647; &#387;u&#7433;o&#387; s&#7433; &#592;&#7433;s&#8704; '&#477;&#623;&#7433;&#647; &#592; &#647;&#592; &#406; &#387;u&#7433;llnd l&#477;uolo&#390; &#477;&#613;&#647; u&#592;&#613;&#647; &#633;&#477;&#613;&#647;o p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; &#647;&#592;&#477;&#633;&#647; o&#647; &#654;&#647;&#7433;l&#7433;q&#592; ou &#613;&#647;&#7433;M -   &#729;&#633;&#477;&#647;&#596;&#592;&#633;&#592;&#613;&#390; &#647;so&#741; &#592; &#653;ou s&#7433; &#1508;NINNIM &#8516;&#741;&#398;&#633;&#8704;q sn &#647;d&#477;&#670; &#647;&#592;&#613;&#647; &#387;u&#7433;&#613;&#647; &#654;luo &#477;&#613;&#647; os '&#398;NO&#1508; S,&#9524;&#8704;H&#9524; 'll&#477;M &#729;s&#477;sn &#477;ld&#7433;&#647;ln&#623; &#387;u&#7433;&#647;&#647;&#477;&#387; 's&#647;u&#477;&#652;&#477; llnd-&#477;&#633; o&#647; &#647;s&#7433;l&#592;&#7433;&#596;&#477;dS &#477;u&#7433;&#647;u&#592;&#633;&#592;nQ &#613;&#647;&#7433;&#653; &#654;&#387;&#633;&#477;u&#654;s &#592; p&#592;&#613; &#477;&#613; pu&#8704; &#729;(dn&#647;&#477;s &#647;&#592; &#477;uoz p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; &#477;&#613;&#647; u&#7433; s,&#400; &#477;lqnop &#607;o &#647;ol &#592; p&#592;&#613; &#477;&#652;,&#477;&#653;) p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; u&#7433;&#592;&#647;uo&#596; &#654;ll&#592;n&#647;&#596;&#592; pu&#592; 's&#477;&#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;S &#477;&#647;&#477;ld&#623;o&#596; &#654;l&#647;u&#477;&#7433;&#596;&#7433;&#607;&#607;&#477; '&#647;u&#477;&#623;d&#7433;nb&#398; llnd plno&#596; 's&#633;&#592;&#596;s p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; o&#647; &#477;un&#623;&#623;&#7433; s&#592;&#653; o&#613;&#653; &#477;uo &#477;&#613;&#647; s&#592;&#653; &#477;H &#729;&#633;&#477;&#7433;ploS &#477;&#613;&#647; s&#592;&#653; &#633;o&#647;&#7433;&#592;&#633;&#647; &#633;nO -  And there's up to 6 more games of this left. Dropped my rating to a 2 in a fit of rage. Screw you, Pandemic Legacy. And I'm not too fond of your booster club, either. </td></tr><tr><td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td><td>161936</td>
<td>2</td><td>Canada</td><td>I am fine with the limited playability. But its just boring. Lots of luck. Not enough strategy for what I like. Not a lot of Oh damn I can't believe that just happened! Which is what I was hoping for. </td></tr><tr><td>Terra Mystica</td><td>120677</td>
<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>I understand and appreciate that a lot of time and energy went into the design, there are just some aspects of the game that are crippling *to me*. I find that the critical nature of my decisions are decreasing as the game wears on to the point that after the first round is over, I'm already past the half-way point on that decline. What faction you pick, and where you start your settlements will have a bigger effect on your success rate than any other factor in our experience (related to how likely it is that someone can effectively steal a spot from you, how effectively you can expand and exploit your faction's specialty, etc). This goes hand in hand with the static setup of the board, so the variable powers have favored setup locations and strategy already defined for them during that critical decision making period. As such, there are only a few spots that are of particular value for each faction, and outside of that, it's not worth it. So the net effect here is that all of my super important choices occur before the first turn, and as the game progresses, each choice I make is less likely to create any serious swing or effect on the end game, to the point where the final 2 rounds are largely auto-pilot in terms of game play.  Second, I find that I have 8 or 10 choices each turn, but really only 1 or 2 of those will do anything other than cause a backslide (similar to the opening setup choices), so I don't spend my time debating choices so much as taking the obvious choice and planning multiple turns of obvious choices in advance. It's a very tight game in that regard where the potential to "catch up" or make breakthroughs to put pressure on opponents in the second half of the game just doesn't exist. I like wide choices where no one choice sinks you and they are largely opportunistic in their timing and accordance with your strategy. Terra Mystica seems to favor a "deep" approach where you don't have as many choices, but you plan for multiple turns in concert.   Last, it takes about four times as long to play a 4p game as I'm realistically interested in investing in said design. A large reason for this is that the late game decisions are all sort of meh. I actually enjoy the game when I can bang out a session online on lodev in 30 minutes.  It's not a bad game, it's just not a game for me. My 7 plays in person (3-4p) and 10+ on lodev have helped me learn my preferences in games, so it's not time wasted, but I won't play it again.</td></tr><tr><td>Caverna: The Cave Farmers</td><td>102794</td>
<td>2</td><td>Germany</td><td>While the mechanics are nice, there is just not enough pressure as in Agricola and the replayability is a lot lower, too. In addition, you do too much per action, diminishing the importance of certain actions.</td></tr><tr><td>7 Wonders Duel</td><td>173346</td>
<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>The art in this game was nice, though the theme was lacking. My husband and I were bored with this one. We did give it a few tries though.</td></tr><tr><td>Puerto Rico</td><td>3076</td>
<td>2</td><td>Norway</td><td>I find this dry, asocial and downright dull. One of few games I'd rather sit out on than play. I know many hold this game in high regard, and I've played it eight times to give it a fair change. But it is clearly not for me. This just doesn't have any of the ingredients I enjoy in a game and I honestly don't see what others like about it.</td></tr><tr><td>Agricola</td><td>31260</td>

<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>I played this game once. After the first of 3 rounds, I honestly thought we had the rules incorrect, as the game was so bad that I was certain that we had missed something.  The only reason this game is rated so well is because of the miniatures. This is the worst game I have ever played within the strategy genre.</td></tr><tr><td>Eclipse</td><td>72125</td>
<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>120102 ok game, I'm not sure what makes it so awesome, but maybe I'll catch on later.

<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>Vote for pure hatred of all things LCG / CCG. And because its top ten ranking is a ridiculous fanboy byproduct... I will never understand how this, Mage Knight, or Eclipse are top 10. The other seven games, I can see why people would rank them highly (and I only like half of them at best). And even Eclipse and Mage Knight, I can almost see it in that fuzzy magic-eye puzzle sort of way, if I turn my head upside-down and squint really hard. Are people just ranking it based on how much money game stores are making off of it? </td></tr><tr><td>Le Havre</td><td>35677</td>

<td>2</td><td>Canada</td><td>Broken Broken Broken. I gave a 2 because it's fun to move the gears.  Why is it broken? I'm surprised you ask. You must not have played a lot with the experts..... What is a broken game? A broken game is a game when ONE AND ONE ONLY AND ALWAYS THE SAME ONE strategy leads to victory. Meaning, if you pursue any other strategy, no matter how good you pursue it and how clever you are, the noob doing the ONE WINNING strategy will outflank you eyes wide shut.  In Tzolk'in case, this strategy is get to 6 workers very fast. Don't feed them by converting wheat to resources. Row 2 level III tech as fast as you can. Pile up, pile up, pile up, pile up like there is no tomorrow. On cycle 4, reap everything, build everything, climb everywhere. and you win with a 200+ score. That's why you don't see any players now doing the skull strategy.  Don't listen to experts who tell you this strategy is counterable. It is not. Unless by the same strategy which proves it is broken. On the contrary, Puerto Rico is not a broken game.</td></tr><tr><td>T.I.M.E Stories</td><td>146508</td>

<td>2</td><td>Argentina</td><td>Why is this game ranked so high? Why the praise? It's just a poor man's Fighting Fantasy book....well, I should've said rich man. Gamebooks are really old, and putting the paragraphs on cards doesn't make something revolutionary. You can buy a FF gamebook for $1. You can find better challenges and puzzles there (House of Hell and Creature of Havoc, for instance), and please remember, you have 400 paragraphs in a FF book. T.I.M.E Stories is FOUR times shorter and FIFTY times more expensive. Ridiculous! And to add insult to injury, cards are wasted in the intro and items you find. A joke. Zero replayability, zero innovation. And the first two themes, used in Asylum and Marcy Case, are pathetic and overused. I expected a crime scene, interrogations and a culprit. I expected a good story, not this. The extra point I give this game is for the art.</td></tr><tr><td>Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game</td><td>150376</td>
<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>Words cannot describe -- I tried Dead of Winter and disliked it a lot. I won't be trying it again -- this isn't my type of game.  First of all, there's no semblance of a struggle to survive in this game. We had to just 'stay alive' for five rounds, but everything we had to do seemed obvious. We weren't over-run by zombies at any point, we fended them off easily, and there was nothing to do except that. Perhaps we tried a bad scenario, but even so, the basic mechanics of the game seemed really...boring.  I dislike zombies in general, and this is a game that would have profited without them. Set this on a desert island, add in some sort of sun beats down mechanic (kind of like Forbidden Desert), and make the zombies wild beasts. You've instantly got a better game just because the survival aspect matches the theme a lot better. The game still would need mechanical tweaks, but the zombie theme was just a huge turnoff overall to me.  I'll try anything at least once, but some games don't need much more for me to dislike them.  Not recommended. Check out [thing=15062][/thing] for a more successful take on the semi-co-op.</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)</td><td>12493</td>

<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>Tons of bits, but random set up can make or break a game. If the game was a 20 minute affair, the random set-up would be acceptable. for a four to six, even eight hour game, it is ridiculous. And if you [b]do[/b] have a fair tile distribution, then the game will be longer -- not a very practical affair.</td></tr><tr><td>Dominant Species</td><td>62219</td>
<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>120102 meh.  I just don't like worker placement mechanisms combined with too much other stuff.   That's why caylus works for me, but these layter more complicated ones do not.</td></tr><tr><td>Roll for the Galaxy</td><td>132531</td>
<td>2</td><td></td><td>Another game that is STRICTLY WORSE as a boardgame as opposed to being a PC game.  + Yay dice.   - We secretly roll dice and secretly assign them, behind a screen. What?! This is the greatest invitation to cheating i have ever seen in any game.  "Don't play with cheaters." Don't design games to have glaring holes that can be exploited at any moment by anyone without any consequences.  - Zero interaction. Literally. Zero. Interaction. The game has four hundred components and they manage to put ZERO interaction in. Invade others' planets. Work together on some developments. Trade goods. Kill their workforce, fight with ships, bribe, bluff, negotiate... Nope. None of it. The game BEGS to be interactive and they manage to destroy all traces of life in it. Shut up, sit down, stare at your part of the game, collect points, go home.  Singleplayer multiplayer boardgames are the worst.  - There's no reason to play this live. You gain NOTHING from playing live that you couldn't gain online. That's a mark of a miserable game. It is only more fiddly, clunky, chaotic, slow.   - A bunch of rules that flavorfully make no sense. The kind you put in to make the game flow exactly as planned, with no regard to flavor. Another classic example of good game design.  2.5/10 Enjoy your spot in the top 100, Roll. You're everything that most BGG raters want.</td></tr><tr><td>Five Tribes</td><td>157354</td>
<td>2</td><td>United States</td><td>Very beautiful and I can see how others may like it, but I want to burn this game with fire.  There is way too much open information to be able to actively consider on a turn.  There is often a best move that can be taken by a player.  It then becomes a where's waldo game of trying to find the best move.  It's difficult to plan on your turn as the board state changes between players.  Wanted to quit half way through (even though I ended up winning).  Will not play this again.</td></tr><tr><td>Dominion</td><td>36218</td>

Unfortunately, I find theme thin and uninteresting and some the mechanics needlessly obtuse and arbitrary. I guess you have to play it several times before you "get" the strategy, but there wasn't much there to interest me. If the strategy isn't intuitive or if I can't figure out what to do after a game, there has to be *something* inherently fun or interesting about the game for me to want to play it again. It's not inherently fun or interesting to me though. Maybe it was partly because of the theme, but I found Ingenious and Qwirkle more engaging and interesting that this game so it wasn't just the dry theme.</td></tr><tr><td>The Castles of Burgundy</td><td>84876</td>

At 2p, I find the game doesn't overstay it's welcome for being multiplayer solitaire combo chaining game. One of my largest complaints is that the downtime between turns as you add players, combined with the inability to make solid plans more than 2 plays in advance really hurts.

And it really doesn't work 2P.  I think there is a good 2P game there, but I haven't found it yet.  The game is not nearly as heavy as its reputation that seemed to had taken hold in my head.  I really like it and I have to admit the artwork is a big reason.  I really like the cartoony nature of it =).  The game moved pretty briskly (I was the only noob) and its an interesting exercise in math on the fly.  Last couple turns kinda drag though.</td></tr><tr><td>Eclipse</td><td>72125</td>

The problem is that it feels like a "civ" game but your civ is too simple.  Entering the arena with Through the Ages is dangerous; the reduced play time buys some slack, but not enough slack to cover how boring parts of this seem so far.  Or, "needs some cards."  Not to increase the luck (there's plenty of that) but to add variation beyond which resources show up (which governs your economic development too much).  Ok, it's deadly dull.  Deadly.

Good players will simply work out what needs to be done and only bad luck will stop them from doing it. The events have a lot of flavour, but they don't really change how you play, just make things easier or harder.   Still, serious gamers might not be it's core audience. If they are, it's a noble failure - if not, it's a disposable frolic.</td></tr><tr><td>Le Havre</td><td>35677</td>

Why are all these cattle just sitting on the dock and why aren't they eating all of the grain right next to them?), and the dominance of the build-steel-ship-steel strategy is making for less and less interesting games without a lot of room to maneuver.

Seems fiddly, messy, random and just plain too long. Definitely has tons of cool theme and looks pretty good, though.  ---  Tried it, but actually hope I hadn't. It confirmed (or even exceeded) all the doubts I had.  Awful, awful game, borderline broken. Long, tedious, random and boring. Ridiculous components, fiddly and messy gameplay - "do this to do that to get what you actually wanted to do done about three turns (and hours) later.. or maybe not at all."   It looks like it wants to be coolest game of all time, but actually could not be further from it. I do like civilization and empire building games, but this is not really one, despite appearances..

Every turn, after each player takes his or her turn, you are faced with a new board. There are random elements that are not significant but can influence the game play, and the game may simply disallow certain options by virtue of the random nature of the board.  If you are good at (or enjoy) managing random turns of events, this game will appeal to you. If herding cats sounds like a thankless task, well, move along then.</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game</td><td>103885</td>

<td>3</td><td>United States</td><td>1st play:  Every once in a while a game comes along that is hyped up, and when I play it, I have to assume I played a different game than everyone else.  This game forces you to stare at an iPad for 2 hours to essentially play Elder Signs.  There's no interesting decisions really, and the story isn't that great if Cthulu isn't your thing.  I'm not even sure there was a story now that I think about it....</td></tr><tr><td>Mansions of Madness: Second Edition</td><td>205059</td>
<td>3</td><td></td><td>This game has a lot of potential but I'd recommend not buying into the hype and waiting at least until there are more scenarios for it. The "60-90min" intro scenario takes 3 hours with a full party and the other scenarios are all said to be longer. Unfortunately a lot of that 3 hours is down time. Unlike Descent's Road to Legend where there's a single peril effect, in this each player has to make a separate horror check which makes the sort of pointless random part of the game take A LOT longer.  P.S. The mini's are not good quality. P.P.S. I hate you Agent Carver.</td></tr><tr><td>Battlestar Galactica</td><td>37111</td>

<td>3</td><td></td><td>Shuffling: the Game.  When a game is STRICTLY worse played live as opposed to online you have to ask yourself how and why on earth did it get made into a boardgame in the first place.  Live it takes 30-40 minutes. Online 5-10. That is 10 minutes of gameplay in 30+ minutes... The rest is shuffling, waiting for your turn, fiddling with cards, counting everything that could and should be done by a computer, not you.  There are countless opportunities to make an error live. You don't know how many cards are left in each stack, in your deck, your opponents'... which is basic and vital information.  There's so much downtime. Due to poor design a third of the game is spent just buying victory points. And worst of all, there's no interaction!  It's okay as an app on your phone. It's miserable as a boardgame.</td></tr><tr><td>Dominion</td><td>36218</td>
<td>3</td><td></td><td>Design philosophy behind Dominion: take a cool new idea and bury it in a game that panders to the lowest common denominator among Eurogamers. Sell lots of units.  When did Eurogames become synonymous with drafting? Oh, yeah, Puerto Rico.  Anyway, beat to the punch by FFG's StarCraft. So it didn't even have newness going for it.</td></tr><tr><td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td><td>161936</td>
<td>4</td><td>United States</td><td> 1st plays: This is a much better version of Pandemic than the original, because the little decisions that you can ignore in pursuit of the greater victory suddenly become meaningful.  I rate the normal Pandemic at a 5 or a 6, and this game is better.  So far though, the game hasn't lived up to the hype - it's interesting but not even close to the best game ever.  2nd play: The game continues to heat up with new objectives, additional player powers and a brutal infection deck.  It's still Pandemic though.  It probably replaces base pandemic for me, and I'm happy to play it, but it ends up being just ok.  I don't understand all the love it's getting, but maybe when we get to May or June I'll come to understand.</td></tr><tr><td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td><td>161936</td>
<td>4</td><td>Brazil</td><td>Exactly like Pandemic, but in a "Tutorial-learn-as-you-play" way of getting you to play the last (and theoretically the most difficult) mission. I don't like pandemic "bad draws = easy lose" way of being, and Legacy is mostly the same in that matter.  And worse. If you play twice and decide you don't like the game, you can't even sell it. That sucks.</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Struggle</td><td>12333</td>

I just can't bring myself to care. It's a "do this to do that" kind of game and I'm less and less interested in those types of things these days. I guess I don't like modern eruos much if this is what they look like. It basically feels like the boring, processional build orders of a computer RTS. Somehow this takes the timing and logistics that thrill me in something like 18xx and turns them into a dull chore. It's probably the modern euro point salad sensibility of weighing various decent options rather than arriving at a devious "aha!" moment.  It's like a Rube Goldberg machine that ends with a wet fart.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>

I've read that a lot of people just like the aspect of building their own farm.  I don't feel like that myself, but maybe that is me being competitive.  I find the victory points have to be considered, which puts a lot of pressure on in terms of: food, fences, family members, animals, vegetables, house construction. Theres a lot to the game and I find it pretty overwhelming.  Hopefully it will get easier. Update: Played for the 3rd time, this time with cards.  I've got to say I just don't enjoy this game. I came 2nd on a 5 player game so I've mostly 'got it' now, but I think I find having too much choice a bit too stressful and I'm too competitive to just enjoy building my own farm.

There is a steep learning curve, and once you are over that, there may be a span of 20 to 30 plays where you are somewhat excited, but it really gets "samey" for win conditions fast. Even with the "secret" objectives that randomize, there's an easy algorithm to winning each match, that you can spot right away. I feel like this is more of a "randomize the puzzle, figure out the code, put game away". For a lot of learning, setup and hassle, I'd rather play several other games that have a deeper theme, better mechanics, and are frankly more fun.</td></tr><tr><td>Agricola</td><td>31260</td>

<td>4</td><td>United States</td><td>130929  Yeah its just too long.  I don't think I will ever play this again.  Pax has everything I want in a game of this type.  And its more thematic to boot.  I just hate the fact that you need to know the deck to play TTR well.  121231 I learned this one day and then Pax Porfiana the next.  I wasn't really that taken with TTA anyways, but Pax just killed it.  I see why TTA is regarded so highly, its a very nice design (albeit physically slightly fiddly).  But not a game I enjoy playing.  If/when I procure a copy of Pax I'd most likely drop this game to a 2 rating.  Aside from personal preference critique, I have to say that I do not like the enclosed playing space of TTA.  All the age cards show up and that creates a closed ecosystem which makes for predictable game playing for those who enjoying honing their skill.  However, I much prefer the partial deck usage of Pax.  It creates an open game history which feels truly thematic.  That said, it is a nice implementation of Sid Meier's Civilization without a map.  I can't imagine that the actually branded Sid Meier Civilization is nearly this good (only read the rules to that game)</td></tr><tr><td>Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization</td><td>25613</td>

I want to like this game, but its like the really cool looking bottle of wine or beer with a cool label, yet tastes terrible and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  What I did like: the maps and minis.   Everything else in this game either requires learning too many rules that aren't intuitive or waiting through significant scenarios for meager rewards. It's not as deep as the Star Wars RPG's I grew up playing, and it's not as fun as battling with the Star Wars minis. I'm sure i'm in the minority, based on the BGG rating, but this game just isn't what I thought it could be, and wasn't all that fun.</td></tr><tr><td>Power Grid</td><td>2651</td>

I think it's an enjoyable mental exercise, but this game is not crazy, it's not loud, it's not funny... I don't really see how it would work in a party atmosphere.   I like the fact that Codenames is a cooperative game. It kinda reminds me of Mysterium, which is a game I really like, and yet, since there are words instead of pictures, usually the guessing part is pretty straight-forward and not as fun. That wouldn't be so bad actually though, if it wasn't for the fact that this game has A LOT of downtime. You sit there watching people thinking to come up with a clue and then listen to other people thinking out loud about what that clue could mean. Then finally it's your turn and you do the exact same thing.   So I don't particularly enjoy Codenames and I really can't see how this could work in a party-like situation. Apparently I just don't see in this box what many other people see. For me it's boring and really too slow and long for what it is.</td></tr><tr><td>Le Havre</td><td>35677</td>

Seems that you do something, but you don't.  No story: If you want to give me a good story. Please, give me enough background, no just small bits that amount to nothing. Go there do that because I say so, is not really a nice plot.  Not enough explanations on rulebook. I know, you wanted to create a system, so let's put things open to fit anything we throw them later. But really? A game with only 2 realy choices (explore (test/move/do nothing)- change location) should be 100% explained.  Too much imprecisions in the cards. Ok, that isn't easy. I guess not enough playtest was on the cases. Some weird ways to do the things, without any explanation.  The system doesn't really works, unless more work is put on the cases. The third run is a mash-up of what you do on first and second ones (but now in the right order, but you are almost not discovering anything). If you by chance need a fourth one, I really pity you. One hour lost repeating things you already now.  If this comment seems resentful, it is. The game seems for moments to find the good ways to present info and deliver an story. And it has some really nice touches. But that's all. Nothing else. And for some moments seems that they didn't playtest some parts.   </td></tr><tr><td>7 Wonders</td><td>68448</td>

<td>4</td><td>Finland</td><td>I have found the genre of theme heavy, co-operative survival games to be one of the most (if not the most) difficult genres to make. Having played a number of them, I have come to a conclusion that most are horrible while only a few are actually good ones. Dead of Winter falls into the category of horrible.   My biggest complaint is about the down time. At the very beginning it is still ok, but once new characters start entering the game it all freezes dead. There are just too many moving pieces on the board and all cohesion is lost. To add to the horror of waiting, an event card is drawn at the beginning of every turn. Ok, this a common mechanic but the cards in Dead of Winter have way too much flavour text. When you have patiently waited for your turn for 10 minutes, you do not want to have the game stop for another 1-2 minutes turn.   It is a fine balance between keeping the game playable and adding &#8220;thematic&#8221; stuff that is supposed to help with the immersion. Easily this extra fluff is not meaningful from the mechanical point of view and does not actually add to the dramatic arc either, but only gives you random and unrelated events.   I am still waiting for the grail in this category of games, i.e., dripping with theme and stories while everything propels the game and the story forward. As of this writing, Arkham Horror is the closest to a grail so far. At least there the down time is not so much of an issue.</td></tr><tr><td>Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game</td><td>150376</td>
<td>4</td><td>Austria</td><td>I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  Another roll and draw American game. I can see why a lot of people may like it, but it's really not my cup of tea. On the plus side I really appreciate that the dice rolling is not crucial on what you can do in your turn, but it also felt underwhelming to me... almost pasted on the game, just to appeal to dice enthusiasts. The realization of the scenario and crisis mechanisms was furthermore poor to me, as it has been done just to give opportunities to the traitor, but they didn't stand on their own. The biggest let down though for me was the concept of the Crossroads cards. What's so innovative about that? It's almost exactly the same idea that Arkham Horror has and it's exactly one of the reasons why I don't like that game. I even thought that I would have liked it better here, because the player couldn't tell when the event would have triggered. Then I discovered that the triggers are so generic, that the event takes place almost every time... making the entire thing almost meaningless.  So again, maybe it's just not my cup of tea. It's another game that it's just all theme and no mechanics. I really don't understand where is the fun in the whole "draw and see what happens" system. I play boardgames to have a challenge and some decisions to make and, if what I want instead is a story, I would much rather play an RPG.</td></tr><tr><td>Caylus</td><td>18602</td>

Like Navegador it feels a highly abstracted design that happens to be played out on a map.    The innovation this time is handbuilding, picking up cards from a face-up row of reducing cost.  Cards all feature actions, but also a God affiliation that provides a multiplier for vps related to various things.  Concordia feels rather slow to get going - building up from almost nothing in incremental steps - and very slow to end.  It's not helped by a feeling of same old, same old collecting resources and converting them into victory points.

<td>4</td><td>United States</td><td>3 plays...I now feel no inclinaiton to play the game again, without some significant house rule changes.  However, I do feel a desire to try and fix it, into something that I will find playable.  The rest of my comments relates to the 'unpatched' version of the game. :)    The role selection system looks like Puerto Rico's, but really, the first guy needs to choose imperial and the second needs initiative to get imperial, or else you just cant get to 10 points faster than the other guys (if you arent doing this, you fall hopelessly behind). ..After that, technology is almost always the best, so really, its just a heirarchy of who gets what for the first several picks.  The only actual 'choice' is at the bottom of the order. Secondly, fighters seem overpowered, while dreadnaughts seem too expensive for their power.  I'm not sure about that, but it worries me.  It seems absolutely critical to build a fight re fleet, or you jsut CANT fight someoen who has such a fleet.  Sure, what capital ships you add to it might be interesting, but it takes so FRICKING long to get the necessary fighter fleet together, and you have to have it, that the ship types loses a lot of its interest for me.     Third, the board setup mechanic, I dont know if I like either.  If you dont get any planets in your hand, you can have nothing decent anywhere near you, and be totally screwed.  Also, it seems that the way you set up, its unfair.  Whoever ends up placing last in a ring is getting screwed, especially if people put blanks near them.  Fourth, the game can often stall out in a 'turtling' excercise.  This makes for a boring 6 hours.  I've sat there for 6 hours and had not participated in a single battle all game.  And for everyone, if you fought someone, it meant the others would pounce on your remains very fast, because battles are so mutually destructive if you dont have overwhelming force.  Also, there often doesnt seem to be much at all to gain from winning battles, except maybe for a certain target due to your card or something.  And if you care about conquest, its because your card forces you to care, and then you only actually care about one location probably, either Mecatol Rex or an enemy home.    Late in the game, you get these huge buildups of 20 fighters and some ship on a location, and your opponent has the same, and if you fight you just annihilate each other and others can walk over you.  Why fight?  Most of the VPs come from taking imperial, and things like having 5 techs, having 3 space docks, paying 10 influence or 6 trade goods, have 1 of each color tech, etc, etc.  I can do that from my little corner of the board, with 5-6 planets next to my homeworld, where I build 6 PDS systems and get deep space cannon so I get 6 free shots at you for comign near me, and just turtle there and fulfill all the non-combat victory conditions and take imperial.   By the time you DO want to beat on someone because they will win, or to fulfill your objective, its so suicidal to do so, you just want someone ELSE to do it, so you can go take the remnants of their empire.  The game also takes FOREVER (around 6 hours, from my several experiences), and you dont seem to get any high level tech (except if you're Jol Nar), until it doesnt matter, because the game is already over.  Either that, or you go entirely for only one certain high level tech, and you get it near the end.  You choose one narrow branch of the tree to go through, out of like three brances that are actually any good.   I really want to like it, but its very difficult.  There isnt a great deal of incentive to attack, and when there is its forced upon you by cards (and the secret objectives seem horribly unbalanced in their difficulty to achieve).  Even then, creating that war with your neighbor is usually suicidal and creates a power vacuum for others near you to rush to take advantage of, as two players fleets are destroyed.  I feel like if I was going to spend 6 hours on a game, it should be Die Macher or something. Fifth, the action cards are rediculously different in power, ranging from things like gain 1 trade good per planet (~6-8), getting a ground unit per planet, or saying 'no one can take initiative this turn, so I keep the speaker and get imperial 2 turns in a row'.  On the flip side, are cards that barely screw one opponent, or that make your War Suns do a slightly better bombard (who fricking cares?).  They are just so wildly different in power that its a total crapshoot. Some of the options, especially distant suns, piss me off.  Actually, distant suns pisses me off so badly it makes me want to quit the game after turn 1 when I flip up radiation and lose everything and get 0 planets, and that other guy gets 3-4 planets and a free spacedock and trade goods or a free tech.  Why play the game if after turn 1 you are screwed due to being far behind in the expansion race, and you have to sit there for another 5 hours to see how you lose?  Or everyone slows down to scout, and it adds an hour to the game.    It really is the case that player 1 must take imperial, player 2 must take initiative, etc.  2 victory points is just such an enormously big part of your score.  There will be a few 1 pointers that come out that are easy, and some guy will get his secret objective for 2, and combined with 2 or 4 from 1-2 takes of imperial, he will win.  If you dont get your 2vps when its your chance, you are just screwed and cant make 10 first, no matter how much you might be killing people militarly.  Not only that, but there is a rediculous advantage to being the first guy to get imperial two times, since then you need only 6 points (6 easy one pointers, or 4 easy ones and an objective).  You just get your second 2 point gain before everyone, and have a tremendous advantage.  Or maybe the second guy to get it.  On the flip side, the guy getting it last is just screwed, as there is no way he gets it twice, and his secret objective merely gets him even with that guy who lucked out and got it twice.  There is just a tremendous disparity between going first (or very early) at the beginning, to going last.  And its because of how broken imperial is (which admittedly, is the 'clock' that makes the game not take  forever).  While its possilbe that a combination of several house rules might fix these various systems (though fixing the turtling problem seems very difficult to me, since there isnt much of any incentive to attack anyway, and you can defend so well with many deep space PDS systems).  So even though it might be fixable, I dont want to have to fix it, and it doesnt seem particularly exciting enough, or give enough cool game for the time investment, to warrant  trying to fix all these mediocre game mechanics.  And thats pretty much how I feel about it, a bunch of mediocre or unexciting or possibly broken game pieces, meshed together to make a very long, 6 hour experience where you sit there and dont get a lot accomplished.  And if you DO go military and manage to do it well without screwing yourself, then some guy has to fricking sit there for HOURS while getting beaten on and having no hope, since he cant possibly win.  I mean, the cool thing about this game is combat.  Late in the game, combat is pretty much suicidal, as even if you overwhelm them and win, you'll lose half your guys and then someone will be able to crush YOU.  If you do it early, when maybe you can catch them unprepared, and it works, then some guys has to suffer through hours of being screwed completely.   Note that my experience was probably more extreme because of playing two four player gmes, where everyone tended to have enough planets.  In the 6 player, some players dont feel that they have enough planets, and are more inclined to attack.  These combats still tend to hurt both players, most of the time, but at least things are more interesting... It feels like a very average, but long and kindof slow/boring game, clouded in a cool theme, and the hype of its coming out.   Yet another thing that annoys me about it is that influence is just so woefully underpowered compared to production.  I just dont care about influence, except to have some planet that gives 3 and no money to get an order token every turn.  Most of the laws are really minor, and the ones that do matter, even though you have 12 influence or whatever, if they decide they are screwing you with it because you're ahead or whatever, you cant really do anything about it.  Or you have all the influence and they play Thugs so you cant vote and screw you.  Whereas the industrial capacity is just so critical to doing anything.  If you get influence planets near you instead of industry, you just get screwed and cant do much of anything, and have trouble getting tech, or a big enough fleet to defend, let alone do anything militarily.  </td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)</td><td>12493</td>

RollftG does not offer the same agonizing trade-offs as its mother because you are not closing doors when paying for the cards in your hand. The only good thing left in RollftG is the action selection and leeching, which is now twice as complicated as before. Usually you would expect complex games to have a lot of depth, since you are balancing between many things, but not in RollftG. You just have a number of choices with a myriad of restrictions but none of them seemed very interesting.

All in all, this game is being carried by its theme, the simple fact there are opportunities to be crafty as cylons and obviously fans of the show (or fanboys of FFG) who will crave to play it like a watered down RPG.

By itself, the game clips right along at 2p, and the probability of deck drawing gives it enough of a risk management that the engine you create doesn't just sit and crank through until late in the game. I like Trains a little more for the deck building mechanic though as it uses an area influence map, but that suffers from a bad theme implementation (while this doesn't have that problem even if it's sort of pasted-on), leaving this as the deck builder of choice. That said, there is basically zero interaction in Dominion, and it's fundamentally about creating a card combo in your engine and running it as hard as possible. The game ultimate seems to flop over once people learn the combos.  Best on the tablet (even the fugly old edition that was free) where it takes almost no time at all to crank out a game.</td></tr><tr><td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td><td>161936</td>

<td>5</td><td>Finland</td><td>2016-10-13 As of this writing we are approximately halfway through the campaign. At this point I feel that the game is really about playing the same Pandemic scenario over and over again. The Legacy thing just adds new game mechanics and rules after every round. And the pace at which the game evolves is fast. At first the changes felt exciting and opening the boxes and dossiers was like Christmas. Now I already feel like I couldn't care less. There is a tsunami of rule breaking exceptions flooding out of every box and it is very difficult to maintain interest in learning all of them properly. Your choices do not seem to affect the future too much. In other words, there are apparent no one way doors that would really make you agonize over your decisions.  The game looks absolutely gorgeous though.  2016-11-10 With three quarters of the game cleared I have to say that Pandemic Legacy achieves to do something many other co-ops do not. At least in our group there has been no single dominant alpha player. Instead the experience has truly been a co-operative one. Ironically this is due the fact nobody has been able to maintain interest in the events all the time.  Finally the first ghosts from the past have started to emerge as your earlier decisions begin to have at least some accumulated effect on the outcome of a month. Moreover, the mystery behind the background story has started to unravel. In my opinion it is quite late for this story arc to develop as the early to mid-game is more or less predictable basic stuff.   I still do not think this is a bad game and I definitely want to play this through. But at the same time I am eager to finish.  2016-11-17 4 months, 7 sessions, 19 games and 20-25 hours (depending on whether you include the time spent on setting up and cleaning). That is how long it took for us to finish the whole campaign. Was it worth it? Hard to say. The game had its moments but in the end, it was still the same Pandemic over and over again. My primary motivation to keep playing stemmed from Pandemic Legacy being the current No. 1 rated game on BGG and as a boardgame hobbyist I felt obliged to go through the experience myself.   In some games we had really really bad luck (the quickest defeat came in six turns) while in other games we felt invincible right from the start. So, the spectrum of luck in the game can be quite wide. We finished the game with a score of 541 points which I would guess to be close to the average. This is also in line with my gut feeling that we had average luck.  That being said, my final thought about the game is that our actions had little to no effect on the final outcome as our month-to-month success was mostly dictated by the luck of draw. Of course, the upgrades we chose during the game made the following months easier but still I did not once think that we had any kind of decisive edge over the fate that was shuffled into the two decks of cards. Perhaps the last two months were an exception when our highly debated decisions in November actually allowed us to win December in the nick of time.   The standard BGG rating system clearly does not work with legacy games. I do not have any desire to play Pandemic Legacy ever again because it is a one time experience. This would be in line with a rating of 3-4. However, at the same time the game works well because it has the same tested and proved Pandemic mechanics running under the hood. Thus the game should be rated a SIX. In the end, I think I am more inclined to rate Pandemic Legacy a FIVE. I did not find the legacy mechanic to enhance the game enough to justify a playing time of 25 hours. This is primarily because your decisions do not alter the course of the game enough and there is only one way to finish the campaign. At the moment, I'd rather play a 60min game of the original Pandemic than commit to playing Season 2 for another 25 hours. However, I fear the latter is inevitable...</td></tr><tr><td>Pandemic Legacy: Season 1</td><td>161936</td>

<td>5</td><td>Italy</td><td>[First impressions] Too long and expensive for what it has to offer, despite its fascinating theme. Card driven in a perverse way: the cards make most of the game, not the players. You have to learn most of them, the phase in which they come up and, even then, you must consider if other specific cards have already being played or not, limiting your choices even more. Some rules are unnecessarily fiddly, others are just too luck ridden (the space race, of course) and having recently played Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has made some of this points even more obvious. It shares with Hannibal one of its biggest flaws, at least from my point of view: just too long for the amount of luck involved.</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Struggle</td><td>12333</td>

<td>5</td><td>United States</td><td>7/7/16: The Theme is strong in this one.  First impressions, needlessly complicated.  Playing teams can get very frustrating.  Like all FFG games, you're buying this for the theme, not the gameplay.  If you don't love Star Wars, I'd stay away from this.  If you're used to wargames, the clunky and swingy combat will be frustrating.  Only FFG  would have come up with dice symbols meaning one thing on one type of roll, and something else on another roll.  What you do get is a very thematic game, with a great story and a ton of great plastic.  You do need to learn what possibilities are made available via the cards, the first time through you're just trying to learn the game.  The cards do cause some wild swings, but that's the nature of the game.  I think that the length is going to kill it for me, but will need more plays to really know.  I don't mind 4 hours of Fury of Dracula, because you're working with a team, but here where it's just one on one, it's a little long for what it offers.  It may also be that I'm slowly burning out on the FFG game style where so much of the game is on cards.  The tactics cards in this game really remind me of the Battlestar Galactica game where your card draws really determine everything.  I don't think that 4 player works all that well unless you have 2 people that work really well together.  The rolls aren't that well defined, and you have to go through everything together which slows things down further..   Learning 2 player game: 4 hours, 4 player game 5.5 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: Rebellion</td><td>187645</td>
<td>5</td><td>United States</td><td>First the good - the game mostly looks great, the rules are not bad (for FFG), minis are cool, and the asymmetric player goals are interesting.  But there is a lot of junk here, the game is inelegant, full of useless and sometimes counterproductive complexity and chrome and the combat is terrible.  Not sure about the balance yet either, I suspect the Imperial player has a slight advantage that is magnified by Rebel inexperience - but I'm almost positive that I will not want to play enough games to find out.  Oh, did I mention the game is long?  Too long by at least an hour.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>5</td><td>Germany</td><td>A 5 might be a bit harsh, usually I'd give this game for the experience that I had a 6.  This rating isn't because of a devastating loss, I actually won my first and only play of it. But it became pretty clear that this game has a runaway leader problem, which probably has to be balanced out by the other players having to unite against the leading player. That the game manual requests that people refrain from actually keeping count of who is ahead in points and how many points are to be gained by an action doesn't help, it seems like it just wants to mask this issue. In our case, it was a little race at the beginning, but the game was pretty much decided after three or four turns, and this in part to the initial setup and the very first random encounter. After half of the game, we could have stopped, the outcome was clear and there was no possibility at all that I could see for the other player to get back into the game, without having done anything wrong himself when playing the game. The unbalanced secret goal cards probably added to this: While one of mine was a breeze to accomplish, both of the other player were rather hard to fulfill.  The game is definitely playable, as in: the game mechanics are working together, but they don't complement each other well enough. When looking under the hood, leaving all that bling (the opulent visuals of the game) behind, the mechanics seem to be tackered together so that there is just some variation and choice for a change of the game state when playing. Despite it seeming very complex at start and when looking at it on the table, there is actually very little "game" to be found in this one.  In hindsight, the game hints at being deep and immersive, but actually there isn't much to it. The only good thing about this is, it's actually quite easy to teach. If you want a game that is designed a lot better with a gameplay similar to this one, then I'd recommend to get Eclipse or Terra Mystica, for example. Skip this one instead.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>

In the game you keep forgetting to use your benefits, since they are not given in clear phases as in TM. Scythe tries to be thematic in its fantasy world, but the theme is basically integrated to the plastic components of the game. Also, you expect Scythe to be conflict oriented game.

I find that I really like the sandbox effect and relaxed feeling of the "feed your people" side-quest compared to Agricola, but you still sit and contest just a couple spaces on the (ever growing) board; the furnishing spot, which is unfortunate (mostly because I'm only passively interested in worker placement as an action draft mechanism). One of my favorite games to solo, I found it best (regardless of solo play or with other people) if you draft in roughly 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the furnishings instead of everything, otherwise the game becomes stale way too quickly. One other thing that I particularly don't like about the game is that it *requires* an organizer, otherwise it takes too long to setup/tear down to justify playing. Second, I found it encourages specialization in the cave so you spend most of your time jockeying for the furnish action.</td></tr><tr><td>Caverna: The Cave Farmers</td><td>102794</td>
<td>5</td><td>Finland</td><td>2014-11 Comparison with Agrigola is obvious here. So similar the games are. In Caverna I liked the way you could upgrade your workers to make them more efficient. But that is really the only reason I would play Caverna over Agrigola.  The sheer amount of information the players are exposed to right from the beginning was so overwhelming here, that I almost lost interest in trying to figure the game out. But what amazed me the most, was that towards the end you seemed to have very little to do despite all the options given to you. Oh, I am sure that after a few more plays you would be familiar with the game allowing you to concentrate more on your strategy.   But why bother? Essentially, Caverna offers very few new experiences to veterans of Agricola and Le Havre. Instead, the game is more cluttered and fiddly lacking the elegance of its predecessors. I also preferred the way, how in Agricola you are trying to find the best way to utilise the randomly drawn cards instead of a prescribed selection of buildings. In short, there are too many components to setup, too much information to digest on your first few plays, too many options to choose from, and still too little to do towards the end of the game.  I would play Caverna if asked, but I won't spend any more time on learning it.  2015-01 6-&gt;5 </td></tr><tr><td>Puerto Rico</td><td>3076</td>
<td>5</td><td>United States</td><td>Variable Phase Selection, fast play, low downtime, (generally) playing against players (not the game, although it is through indirect mechanical interaction more than anything else), and a long supply chain really amount to a decent game overall. The greatest coup was getting my parents to play game after game after game. Two downsides are that you either need more buildings, or content to deal with your existing options as it's a static setup. Second, it is the namesake of the problem that many other "seat-order dependency" games suffer from where it's the responsibility of the person next to you to keep you in check more so than players across the table. Really fiddly in my experience, although I suppose some of that can be reduced. I loathe the instruction manual. I understand why this is considered Seyfarth's star accomplishment.  Update; This is a game that I find I enjoy best when I binge and I think that's because of the setup time. For some reason the second and third game generally make me happier than the first one of an evening, so it rarely comes out anymore.

<td>5</td><td></td><td>After A: NR did so well in Geek Madness a couple of years ago I decided to give it a try. There are a couple of really nice things about the game. First of all the extremely asymmetric game play makes it so that the corp player and the runner play by their own set of rules. Second is the way the corp uses hidden information to try to control the runner, while the runner tries to predict what the corp is doing. These two elements not only create a compelling dynamic with regard to player interaction but are the foundation for the themes the game is exploring.  Unfortunately it's an LCG. This undermines player interaction by putting too much focus on analyzing a constantly evolving card set. And what you get in the starter set just isn't good enough when compared to similar games. The fact that the game is built around being endlessly expandable means the base set comes with a whole lot of extra rules baggage you only need if you are going to do a lot of deck building.  If you want a two player pseudo CCG without having to play the "meta" game get FFG's brilliant [thing=147154]Blue Moon Legends[/thing]. While asymmetric, it doesn't have the extreme asymmetry of A: NR. But it does have all the mind games and player interaction, without the rules overhead.</td></tr><tr><td>Android: Netrunner</td><td>124742</td>
<td>5</td><td>Finland</td><td>Android Netrunner has quite an interesting theme and all the jargon used in the game adds to the atmosphere (although I have to say that it makes learning the game a lot harder). Fog of war is also nicely executed with the corporation player playing his defenses face down. Figuring out the best combos from your cards is fun as well.  After a few plays the bad stuff kicks in, though. It is extremely boring to play the corporation. You are basically just sitting there waiting for the runner player to attack or waiting for the scoring cards to appear. I guess it says enough if you use the word "wait" twice in a sentence. Moreover, the rulebook is as bad as you can expect from Fantasy Flight Games. It is absolutely useless if you are trying to find some important rules. All rules having a big impact on the game play (the maximum Memory Units the Runner has at his disposal, for example) should be at least bolded or made stand out from the rest of the text. But no. Now everything is scattered all over the rulebook and some rules cannot be even found under the title explicitly referring to them making it impossible to find the piece of information you need quickly.   I definitely cannot understand how this is so popular of a game. Yes, I can see that there a good qualities to it but to me it felt unexciting and shallow. Oh, I know that some (or most) people don't agree with the shallow part, but if it takes tens of plays to see the depth, I won't be doing it. The few plays I have under my belt were enough to convince me against of buying this game.</td></tr><tr><td>Android: Netrunner</td><td>124742</td>

<td>5</td><td>United States</td><td>Some thoughts I had after two different evenings (6-7 games): Neat game, but overpriced for what you get. By the end of the first evening, a couple of us had figured out that the game turns and sort of breaks when you get someone as a codemaster who is really good at concept association (and thus good at being the ghost in Mysterium, the clue giver in Concept, etc). The people who just did straight association of words (e.g. "Musicians, 2" and yields "Kid, Rock") had a much rougher/tense go at it than the people who did conceptual linking to examples (e.g. "Jurisdiction, 6" and ended up with London, New York, Australia, Bermuda, etc which just sort of ends the game). The difference is you can still get screwed by interpretation of the dream cards in Mysterium (or just get a shitty draw) where as it just sort of falls over here. Reminds me of Set in that regard (where skill imbalance is a key factor). Second, the game dragged ass above 9 players. The discussion phase lags because you're waiting in lock step for a clue to be given where as in Mysterium you can be working on someone else's clue while you wait for your own. Our best games we had in that regard were at 5p, maybe 6p. Above that, and I'd probably break up into two groups and play something else. I think one of the most telling things is that with Mysterium, we played that until they made us go home every week for like 6 weeks, where as this, we played for maybe 2 hours and everyone was ready for something new after just the first week (both groups on different days even...) It's a game I'll play if it shows up (and there isn't anything else to play right off hand), but I'd never buy it.  almost a year later, I find it's ok (still just a 5), but it improves some if you use dixit cards instead of words. Codenames Pictures (this fall) uses a similar twist. Baring that, I think it should be a requirement that there are no single guess clues.</td></tr><tr><td>Codenames</td><td>178900</td>
<td>5</td><td>United States</td><td>I had heard a lot of buzz around this game before I got the chance to play it, and at the time I didn't get what all the excitement was about.  Having now played it, I have to say... I still don't get it.  Well, maybe I can see why other people like it, but it just doesn't do it for me.  The game is very thin on theme which, being a Eurogamer, doesn't usually bother me so long as the game is interesting mechanically, but this one falls flat in that regard as well.  This game is highly prone to analysis paralysis if you don't use a timer (which I didn't in any of my plays), resulting in most players sitting around doing nothing while one or a small portion of players thinks long and hard.  The play time on the box says 15 minutes, but our games took more like 30, and it felt like more than 30 due to the down time.  There's very little thinking or planning you can do outside of your own turn unless you are a clue-giver, which makes the down time more pronounced.  The limitation of single word clues is highly restrictive, and trying to give clues about a randomly selected group of words is even more restrictive.  It's extremely difficult to come up with clues that will lead to more than 2 answers unless the board favors such clues, and even if you could come up with such a clue, odds are it would be so obscure or convoluted that your teammate(s) would never guess it.  Typically the best you can hope to accomplish in a turn is to get two answers correct, usually with the second one being a bit of a toss-up.  I usually agree with the adage that restrictions breed creativity, but the restrictions in this game feel so much so that it chokes out creativity.  Additionally, it's very hard to carry any information over from turn to turn.  Usually you will find the clues your teammate was going for, meaning you are back to square one the next round.  Blindly guessing is not a valid strategy except in desperate situations as you can hit an opponent's word or, worse, hit the assassin and lose straight out (which is not only disappointing for the losing team, but is a rather lame way to win).  I generally find Vlaada Chvatil games overly fiddly with an excessive number of rules, and while I don't find this game fiddly, I do find it too confining.  I don't know whether it would be better off with more rules or less, but I do know this isn't a game for me.  If I want to play a game that involves giving clues and trying to think like someone else, I will reach for Dixit or Mysterium instead.</td></tr><tr><td>Codenames</td><td>178900</td>

The rules are not bad per se, but they could have been implemented better. Lots of questions arise in the details, and there is much potential for human error.

<td>5</td><td>United States</td><td>A very good game but there's not enough here to interest me.  It's about building an engine, of sorts, in order to score more VP than your opponents.  But the engine is assembled in pieces and you don't know most of the major VP parts until Autumn (the third season).  Also, the person or persons who lose out on the boats get screwed on meeples and meeples = power so they're really kicked in the shins.  The disparity there really annoys me, as does the fact that the engine is obtuse until the game unfolds enough to inform you.  Not for me.</td></tr><tr><td>Keyflower</td><td>122515</td>

<td>5</td><td>United States</td><td>I really wanted to like this game, and I did.  At least until half way through the game when we discovered that the game had a huge and utterly ridiculous design flaw, which entirely ruined it.  It's possible to spend half of the game building a perfectly good engine for making money, only to have someone - in a single move - completely destroy that engine for the game.  This isn't just bad planning, mistakes or bad luck - this is just a basic flaw in the design of the game.    In our very first play, we had a situation where a player was competitive for the first half of the game - but one move by another player just killed the game for that player (and it wasn't even remotely aimed at hurting the player), who then spent the second half (about an hour and a half) of the game losing money (no matter what they did) and it was really obvious as soon as it happened that this was going to be the case.  Apologists for this horribly overrated game will argue that you can avoid this situation [i]once you know about it[/i], but you shouldn't have to [i]plan[/i] to avoid a clear flaw in the game.  Long games with such a huge flaw should be avoided like the plague...</td></tr><tr><td>Food Chain Magnate</td><td>175914</td>

It's undoubtedly clever, and has some wickedly humorous touches regarding market forces &amp; competition, but for me  it felt too big and sprawling. My other main gripes are that the milestones and single availability cards simply rankled, as did the forced completion of full orders -  customers might see advertising for beer, burgers and pizza, but should they really have to buy them all or not buy anything?</td></tr><tr><td>Food Chain Magnate</td><td>175914</td>

Played this game 3 more times, and we did not finished none, because at middle game one player had the lead and everybody knew he will be the winner. This game has a very serious problem of run way leader, and the richest gets richer even with players at the same level, and does not have any catch up mechanism.

Among players who have played only few games, that is. The game may turn out to be well balanced among experienced players, but it is not among beginners in this game. Furthermore it leaves a bad feeling, that the easiest way to be succesful is imore or less ignoring the whole travelling part, and simply getting goods and selling them through contracts, so reducing the game to a very simple stupid game.</td></tr><tr><td>The Voyages of Marco Polo</td><td>171623</td>

Enjoyed the theme and the added complexity but it has likely lost the marvellous simplicity of SJ. It certainly felt pretty solitaire which was compounded by the fact that we couldn't easily see what cards the other players had laid. Contrast SJ where its easy to see who has played what, and how your choices will aid or constrain them. Clearly familiarity with the icons is necessary before giving a considered rating.  Played 2 players twice tonight - the icons are pretty much fine and it's a better game with 2 players rather than 4 I think. How the forthcoming expansions with added players will fare will be interesting to see. I still have a feeling that the game is a touch fiddly for what it is, and the player interaction (at least in the base game) remains limited. It's partly my advancing years that lead me to like vanilla best, so SJ will likely remain my favourite of the two!</td></tr><tr><td>Race for the Galaxy</td><td>28143</td>

At first, it was terribly difficult to grok, although after introducing it to a few folks, gamers seem to get it pretty quickly. In brighter light, the brown/orange color blind problem is much less although still annoying. But for me it reduces itself to a random puzzle game: you play the hand you're dealt and after that, it greatly depends on the cards you get with the advantage going not to skill, but knowledge of the deck - a trait I particularly dislike in a game. Yes, there are important decisions, but I believe it's much more based on luck favoring the prepared. It is Magic the Gathering without deck building. Is that a great game? I don't think so at all.

The board is not modular, so its going to be same-same for repeated plays. Black is there, red is up there and blue hugs the river, etc.  As a Civ game, it lacks confrontation. the only 'war-ish' behaviour comes from opponents taking what you need first or just so happens there was nothing else they can do thus, they expand their territory in that pattern for that particular game session. Gamers expanded, as there was minimal choice, not because it was a strategy. It's not a game, so much as to screw your opponents up that creates confrontation, but its just a simple turn taking event that lead to a certain condition that is 'left by what is available to do.' The options are not 'always' available. Thus I do not see how this game could be that Civ-vy. Once you are there, you are there. period. Not for resources per se, but the changing/upgrading of structures brings new powers and completely removes the old. There is no 'stack em up' ladder.  removing all the beautiful art work, and what we have is a simple exercise of take A to get B and take B to Get C. That's good.....but you have to throw away A and B for that C.  Lots of game have been there and done that. There was no 'situational' gaming aspect that makes it a game to concentrate on. (Like a wargame about stalingrad, even though it may be the same situational battle, the outcome hovers on an expected antagonistic play. Further randomnised by uncertainty in dice rolling....)  Having said that, its a fun exercise with the right group of gamers. Especially those that hate confrontational wipeouts. The lack of random dice does create a math calculation kind of game play.  Beautiful components and artwork. Gameplay is smooth with some decision making in the beginning, but reduces dramatically near end game.  An above average game.</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: Rebellion</td><td>187645</td>

However, the game does drag a bit and if you play this game with someone who in the slightest might not enjoy longer games or is not a very experienced gamer, their confusion and ultimate dislike of the game really makes it unplayable. I have no one to play this game with and it's unlikely I'll find someone anytime soon, so that's why my rating is averaged out to where it is.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>I have had the opportunity to playtest this game in wave 3 and have played in 6 times in less than 2 weeks!  This game is fabulous, and definitely one of a kind.  The end game condition is similar to Euphoria where it ends on stars, but having the vp multiplier based on territories, stars and resources takes it up a notch. Not only do you have to be worried about the last star going out, but you also have to keep track of your popularity.  There is so much good to be said about this game, I enjoy it the most with 3 players and we were typically able to finish a game in under 75 minutes.  There are not very many games that pack so much punch in such a short time. Highly recommended!</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>6</td><td>United Kingdom</td><td>Very fluid and attractive game but after a few plays I don't have a burning desire to play it again. Although you get to make a good number of decisions for the playtime, I don't find many of them particularly interesting. Your overall strategy is mostly determined by the action board you get because the 2/3 coin bonuses are impossible to ignore.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>1 play / 5 players  LIKE: So many powers to explore, and a lot of different setups. Having the two board combo was interesting. Beautiful art and highly produced bits. The war tension was fun and not overly threatening (except at the end).   DISLIKE: Our game went very long. I felt the mid-game stalled and I became bored. Some player powers are clearly better than others. The encounter cards were boring. Fiddly. The theme did not add anything for me.  OVERALL: This game plays very similar to Antike, but Antike plays faster and feels streamlined. Scythe does have its fun moments, but it also had moments where my turn didn't feel that interesting, so it would drag a little. I'd rather play Terra Mystica, or Viticulture-- Scythe relies too much on its theme to elevate it above the hordes of modern games. </td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>There is a lot to teach with this game and for my group, its unfortunate that the first few rounds are basically just figuring out how everything works. It is easy to catch on after a bit, but I doubt if I would want to bother teaching it to anyone else or if my group would want to play again. I'd play again if I didn't have to teach.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>

Even this game has battles, it is tame. You can't ruin your opponent's game.   Collectors edition's components were superb.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>1st play: Thematically this game is awesome.  Post-war mechs being repurposed as farm support, limited but purposeful combat and an amazing production with metal coins, giant board and plastic mechs.  In terms of mechanics I'm not so sure.  It felt like there was more downtime than there should have been, and very little interaction between players.  The optimization game of trying to double up actions made for some thinky bits and when you pull off a combo it's satisfying.  As always, I hate when games could easily have equal turns but choose not to.  2nd play: After said and done, an average game.  The mechanics feel a little more clunky than they need to (with dual actions each move but each player having different combos of dual actions it's hard to keep track of each other player's playerboard.  Knowing which factions can go to which terrain types and which factions combo trading with mechs vs trading with enlist.  The result is a pretty multi-player solitaire game.  The theme is great though.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>6</td><td>Singapore</td><td>Worker placement light, combat 'dune' type light, wargame bloodless light as you don't even need to rebuild. Theme is great but not important. Miniatures are pretty nice but not exactly necessary. General overall production is of great value.  The removing cubes to gain more and cost less for second action is not new, but works fine here. I can understand why there are only six stars needed to end the game, as most resources within the player playmat would have been exhausted. Small feel of Agricola meets Dune.   The end game boils down to coins, with area control and resources being measured for success. No victory objective. Just senseless battles for an area that may not even be connected to your empire.   Cards add a more variety to victory and makes the game already chaotic as it is. Kemet feel to it, but thematically weaker.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>The game has no arc. It has an anti-climacfic and abrupt ending. There is a serious runaway leader problem. I can usually tell who is likely to win halfway through, and there is rarely anything anyone can do about it. This is largely because the methods of interaction in this game are so extraordinarily unsatisfying.  You can "attack" people, but only occasionally and situationally will you really hurt them. Combat feels empty and flat. There are rarely serious consequences to losing a combat. In fact, good combat decisions are virtually always pre-scripted if players are playing competently. It's an incredibly important and yet lifeless aspect of the game.  I'm not saying scythe is all bad. It has a unique character and some interesting euro decisions. But I believe that scythe is also about an inch deep and a mile wide. It looks and feels epic. But the weight of decisions are somewhat flimsy and largely about being slightly more efficient than the other guys and gals. The asymmetrical player boards are all different flavors of the same thing. Practically the only difference from game to game is if your faction synergizes especially well with your player board or not.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>

<td>6</td><td></td><td>A well designed, 4X civilization builder that reminds me of both Eclipse and Clash of Cultures, which are both very worthy designs.  Of the three, I might actually prefer Scythe which is saying something, in part, because I like the variable starting conditions and the way victory points are distributed at the end using popularity, objectives (stars), hexes controlled, and resources controlled.     The art is dystopic, appropriate to its theme, and the components in the collectors edition are top notch.  Combat seems to be dialed at about the right level.  Our five player game played surprisingly well for that player count.</td></tr><tr><td>Scythe</td><td>169786</td>

The game is fast, and the draft is clever.  I'm not a huge fan of 7 wonders, I'm always willing to play tho, and this is a suitable replacement for 7 wonders when there's only 2 players.  Because almost every card comes out every game, I don't know how similar repeat plays will feel.  2nd play: The game is fine, true to the original 7 wonders.  I'm not a huge fan of 7 wonders, though I won't turn down a game.  I've never felt the need to own it and this implementation feels the same to me.  The problem is, one of the strengths of 7 wonders is the flexibility of player counts.  Duel gives that up.  Plenty of 2p games I'd rather play.</td></tr><tr><td>7 Wonders Duel</td><td>173346</td>

<td>6</td><td>Italy</td><td>A great game, with clever and well crafted mechanics, but I'm afraid it's not my cup of tea.  The role selection model is simple and functional, reducing downtime and overall playing time. It also helps beginners in learning the game, with each player going through each selected phase every turn, an useful bonus for a game that doesn't lack its complexities: from the specific rules of each role to the proper understanding of the various buildings.  On the long run the gameplay seems to rarely diverge from a limited number of optimum strategies, also being, quite often, really sensitive to the number of players and their skill level. Interaction is limited to selecting roles and buildings that can advantage you more than your opponents and not selecting the ones that do the opposite, but, to me, it still feels like a multiplayer optimization rush with almost no direct interplay and little space for errors.  Still, a really good piece of work per se.  Rio Grande version. Simple but solid and functional components. Not really impressed by the text-only building tiles: function over form, I suppose, but even a small illustration could have been the final touch (the San Juan based alternative, here on the Geek, is a good example). Really good rulebook. </td></tr><tr><td>Puerto Rico</td><td>3076</td>

Cons: so-so theme (Plantation owner???); small player interaction (with some auto-play turns and lots of dependence on other player's role choices); somewhat unforgiving of play mistakes (especially early on). No dice rolling.  Conclusion: it's a successful game because it works as printed. The game does get fairly heavy in the late stages and some players will have brain lock-up (yours truly) over a crucial decision (followed by brain fatigue after the game). It's not a game that I would seek out to play (like in tournaments) but if others clamored to play it, I'd reluctantly join in. </td></tr><tr><td>Puerto Rico</td><td>3076</td>

The tiles selected are not chosen by a rondel, as in Glen More, but by rolling two dice and using tokens to manipulate the resources, as in La Venise Du Nord. Set-collection plays a  big role, gathering multiple tiles of the same colour scores you points and completing a coloured region gives you further bonuses, as in Thurn and Taxis. The rules explanation is fairly long due to the amount of tiles available with different features, but the game is an enjoyable puzzle, if a little dry.

The game looks like "butter scraped over too much bread"... there're just too many ways to get points, which makes everything seem kinda pointless (no pun intended).  Also the components are HORRIBLE, like I saw also in other Feld's games.

Love the Civ-like theme, but the game seems very fiddly and really ugly, so I'm not too excited..  ***  Took me ages before I finally got to try this one.. It also took us ages (4 hours) to finish our 3-player game.  My first impression is really torn. I love Civ and this does give me some of that good old Civ-feeling. At the same time it gives me a lot of the micromanagement and tedious bookkeeping I really don't care for. The mechanics are pretty ingenious, but overall the fiddliness bothers me. I understand the elegant abstraction of the design, but I do miss a map.. When I think of a Civilization game, I'm thinking of something beefier than a glorified card game. I also have a problem with the butt-ugly art and graphic design. The main thing - the progress through the ages - flows quite beautifully, though.. although it does take it's time!  So.. I love parts of it, but for my taste it's too ugly, too fiddly and plain too long, and I don't see myself playing it very often.. This knocks points off the design, that is otherwise pretty impressive. I'll settle for a 7. Also, it's definitely too pricey for what you get. </td></tr><tr><td>Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization</td><td>25613</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>:cry: :) :D :) This is a perfectly serviceable and well-made ultra-long game. It didn't amaze me the way my top three ultra-long games (18xx, Twilight Struggle, Maria) do. But it's a LOT more fun than some things I've played of roughly equal length. It's got a bit too much direct confrontation via military actions to ever really be a favorite, but I'd at least be willing to try this one again (we played the Advanced game with just two ages and honestly if one player was not taking forever and a day on her turns, it might have gone over better with me). The down side is we had a runaway leader problem although he was a much more advanced player than the rest of us (two newbies and one guy who said he's not very good at it); however I found it nearly impossible to get culture, which is VP, and advancing culture advances your VP increase every round. Our runaway leader had a "leader" card which gave him a colony bonus, and a military nobody could assail (by the time you got your military up to his, he built even further so you could just never attack him on your next turn). Twiddling everything every round was annoying (also the "leader" kept moving the wrong pieces; the board is AWFUL for scoring/tracking purposes -- it's straightforward but it's too small and too easy to screw up things that are changing constantly -- having the levels of stuff on your OWN board AND the main board, while redundant, would be my recommendation) And it's basically a tableau builder, which is something I don't mind. The resource mechanic is very, very good in the game... very economical and clever. But, once again, I played a top ten BGG game and found myself asking, "that's what people find so amazing?" I mean, it was adequate and I can't think of anything downright terrible about it, but my socks weren't exactly knocked off.   Second impression knocked it back to a 5; I'll play, but the military stuff makes it into "bash the loser" so if you fall behind you will just get utterly pummeled and continue to fall further behind. And that's really, REALLY stupid for a four hour game (the Full Game rules must recognize this, as resigning is a legal move!). You're basically forced to play a certain way, which sucks out a lot of the fun. Especially since the rest of the game is very good; if military aggressions and wars were waged against some unseen enemy, rather than other players, I'd feel a lot better about this game.  Third impression after lots of plays gets it to a 6. I'll play it but mostly because I'm stubbornly trying to "get it" rather than because I love it. Once you start having a clue what to do it becomes less painful but this is a game you have to really stick with to come to appreciate, and the online version helps a ton with that. I'll never LOVE the take-that, bash-the-weak mechanics, but I at least got decent enough to no longer find them completely crippling.</td></tr><tr><td>Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization</td><td>25613</td>

There's a lot to take in and I think I'd want at least a couple more sessions before attempting to teach it. But it's very attractive and satisfying to puzzle out. There's a tangible sense of freedom and adventure.   As per FCM and TTA, I fully expect this rating to go up with more plays.  edit: nope. while it certainly works and it's a well put-together beast of a game, its too long and too much effort for the payoff IMO.</td></tr><tr><td>Mage Knight Board Game</td><td>96848</td>

<td>6</td><td>Canada</td><td>In short, I was glad that I played the game, I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I am happy that I didn't buy it.   Here is what I didn't like:  - The down-time with four was pretty ridiculous, yes, it was learning game, and yes, this probably goes down with more plays... but still.  - The learning curve was steep. I was glad that somebody else was teaching the game because I would not want that job... so many little details - yes, most of them could be learned when they arose, but I couldn't help frequently asking myself, "what is this or that little detail adding to the game experience... would the game still be good without it?" I'm sure the rules aren't that complex once you get them but you need to be a hard-core gamer to go through the effort and most of my friends don't fit into this category.  - The theme. Actually, to answer one of my questions above, my impression was that many of the complex rules where there to further develop the theme. Indeed, insofar as the thematicness of a game is measured by the beautiful components and rules that directly represent thematic situations, the game is extremely thematic. For me, though, the theme didn't really work on another level - I like my heroes to be defined by some larger concern or struggle, but the heroes in this game are just seeking power. I don't find that thematically interesting. I think I would have enjoyed this kind of system much more had it been applied to a co-op or an accordingly balanced full-out confrontational game.  - This game is multiplayer solitaire with indirect confrontation of the annoying kind. Essentially, you interact with other players only by stealing things from underneath of their noses. My impression is that the game works kind of like this: a lot of your play is determined by circumstances created by other players... however, these players are generally playing to first and foremost further their own self-interest and not to hinder that of others... in most situations, hindering the interests of others is just inconvenient and would pull both the hinderer and the hindered behind everyone else. Thus, when someone effects someone else its because they happened to be in a position where it was possible for them to do this. In other words, the hindered person just got unlucky in a big way, which is't cool in this sort of game.   So, those are my impressions of Mage Knight after a 3+ hour mini-learning game. It probably all sounds rather harsh but I'm just trying to look at it objectively. In fact, I didn't dislike the game and will probably like it more with more plays. However, I would be very surprised if my rating of this game would ever go higher than a 7. </td></tr><tr><td>Mage Knight Board Game</td><td>96848</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>This is a thinking man's version of something akin to Runebound. Very tightly wound, there are a surprising amount of subtle rules to track (e.g. there are many location types and card types in the game) which leads to rules references and complexity. This is to be expected from any elaborate fantasy adventure game. I enjoyed it very much over all, and although it is true there is 'strategy' to the game, it's more a very well done adventure experience. The use of cards is smarter than I expected, but it certainly isn't a deck builder. More like a deck-driven action game. It takes a very long time to play out - which is expected as well, but exhausting. Still, very good game.</td></tr><tr><td>Mage Knight Board Game</td><td>96848</td>
<td>6</td><td>Finland</td><td>Oh Bloody Chv&#225;til, what have you done again. You have given us a rather simple game with so many layers that it has become very difficult to learn, memorise and teach the rules. It certainly is not a good quality to a game if you have to spend your first plays browsing through the rulebook pondering how everything works. Sure, you can watch the tutorial videos and read the rules and think "OK, now I've got this." But when it is the time to play, you will be facing so many exceptional situations that you just have to check, how it goes again. There is a need for tracking of so many things simultaneously, i.e., you are constantly flipping tokens, pushing tokens, drawing cards, playing cards, rolling dice etc. All this while trying to keep all the restrictions in mind. There are too many things you have to get into your kinetic memory.  Once every single player in the table gets a hang of it, the game becomes a smooth, fast and enjoyable experience. But I literally mean EVERYONE. Should there be even a single player who requires assistance with the rules, the flow is gone.  When it comes to the gameplay, I like the deck building and hand management aspect. It is a brilliant choice for a RPG style boardgame adding more decision making and strategy to the standard action point allocation system. It is also a nice thing that battles are not totally random. However, a hint of uncertainty and push-your-luck elements in the battle would have been nice. Not too random but just a tiny little bit. With a deterministic battle system you know exactly whether you can beat the monster or not. This does not encourage heroic moves against against all odds.   In a nutshell, a fun game and a fun experience. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that Mage Knight is a single use fun. By single I mean that you'll probably play this quite a bit at one time of your life, but after that never again. Re-learning the game will be just too much of an effort for occasional playing, and hence the game will stay in your shelf untouched ever after, no matter how good it was and how fond memories you have of it. But if you have time, investing it in Mage Knight is not a bad choice.</td></tr><tr><td>Mage Knight Board Game</td><td>96848</td>

<td>6</td><td>Finland</td><td>Blood Rage sure has cool miniatures (or not). Mounting the minis onto a removable bases of varying colours is also a neat solution to denote the owner of the monster. Rules are rather simple and the game can be started quite quickly.   It is nice that you decide your strategy on the basis of the initial card draft. Thus you can play differently from game to game, sometimes you even have to if you do not get the cards needed for a certain strategy. I also liked that there are two more drafting rounds, when you can make changes to your strategy if needed, or push even further along the path you chose initially.  However, already after the first game everyone in our group felt that we had seen every trick you can pull off during a game, take a few we could not think of. I was not left with an urge to play again to try something different. I take this as a sign of a rather one dimensional game. Yes, the play was fun but it is a shame if you "crack" the code at the first play.  One more thing worth mentioning is the absolutely horrible choice of font. Despite being printed in big and bold the names of the areas are really difficult to read.  The conclusion says that Blood Rage is a nice game but I am afraid it is rather short lived, unless expansions introduce some longevity elements to it.</td></tr><tr><td>Blood Rage</td><td>170216</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>This game has lots of things I like; courtesy of the rubber band effect, it stays close till the end (but I understand why it's annoying to make any inroads before the end only to have them erased and with experienced players, it's just a jockeying for positional bounce). It has area influence/control elements in terms of route building and pricing of the locations. The nuance of the auction in terms of both bidding and nominating is fantastic. It's a game that rewards those who understand how to ride (and abuse) the turn order system, and can do long budgeting (much more so than other auction/econ games). I generally enjoy playing it, but I just don't get jazzed about the game; I don't request it, and I admit, I'll sort of think of whether I want to dedicate that sort of time to it if asked. It's a game where if someone said "you have 4 hours, would you rather play 1 game of Indonesia or 2 of Power Grid" I'd say Indonesia hands down, but if I only have 90-120 minutes, then I'd consider Power Grid. It fits in that smaller time frame.</td></tr><tr><td>Power Grid</td><td>2651</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>Solid German game. I think the theme is better connected to the mechanics than Puerto Rico. Though I can't ever imagine myself saying "why doesn't someone make a game on buying power plants and the rights to power up cities", this game works and works pretty well if you're into the theme. There's great tension in the bidding process and the ever-changing available power plants. The map boards seem to create interesting dilemmas of position and placement. Overall, the game pieces are deluxe and nicely done with one exception: why the rules aren't in color is beyond me. I do have a creative design critique: why make the different types of wooden goods in strange shapes as non-cubes tend to roll around. I would have been satisfied with just different colored cubes but I'm more of a "functional gamer." I disagree with some reviewers with their belief that it's too mathematical as one can play most of this game without decisions being bogged down in equations. The very end-game (last couple of turns) can get math-heavy but the decisions are few at this point. It is an economic game with a focus on using your cash wisely and that's not going to appeal to everybody. This one should see plenty of play in our gaming group.   Update: Lowering my rating from 8.5 to 6.5. I was wrong as the game is too math heavy for my taste. To play it well, you have to be planning at least a full turn ahead and calculate your money down to the last dollar. It has a run-away leader problem as there's very little you can do (without destroying yourself) to reign someone in if they get lucky in auctions. The auction mechanism can unbalance the game. Players may over pay for what are visible plants only to see a fresh plant pop up late in a turn that gives the loser of earlier auctions a golden opportunity (broken auction mechanism to me). It's also better to place later on the board for starting positions as there's no where to hide without hurting yourself and it's better to respond to player's positions than to try and stake one out. And how many auction games does the world need?</td></tr><tr><td>Power Grid</td><td>2651</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>This really is a fantastic game!  It's an easy 9 after several games played.  Presently, the only thing keeping it from being a 10 for me is that if you do poorly in the early game, you can end up just being along for the ride for a couple hours with no hope of victory.  Maybe this impression will change as I get better with the game, though.  Update: I really, really want to enjoy the game.  Seriously, it drives me crazy, but I just don't think I do.  The issue I mentioned in my early impressions hasn't cleared up.  It feels like fairly early in the game, several people will be effectively eliminated, leaving the major players to fight it out.  These quasi-eliminated players don't really have fun for the rest of the game, and I just can't rate a game highly when several players won't enjoy it every game.

<td>6</td><td>Finland</td><td>2014-09-15 I've got really mixed feelings over this one. The theme can't get much better, but somehow the cluttered set of rules stand in the way of immersion. Instead of pondering what's best for survival, you spend your time trying to figure out how the book keeping works and what is written on all the cards. Furthermore, there are certain actions that are absolute necessities, but why make execution of those actions too complicated. Take hunting for an example. Thematically it makes sense, that you first have to track down the animals before hunting them down. But for gameplay, it just makes it too complicated.   I guess Robinson Crusoe will get better after half a dozen of games under your belt, but considering its length, I just do not see myself playing often enough.  Here is my tip for all you designers out there making thematic games. Keep the rules fairly simple and ask yourself whether you could streamline the rules so that things are accomplished with single actions instead of small incremental ones. Ask the play testers, whether they actually felt like being in the game instead of trying to figure out, in which order to perform things.  Robinson Crusoe is by no means broken, and I could play again. It is just a bit too fiddly for my taste of thematic co-ops. But at least it's better than Castaways, which is a half finished product compared to this one.  2016-11-23 I have to add that this game can be ridiculously hard to the point that it is not enjoyable anymore. I love challenges and I do not mind losing. However, I do want to feel that, despite failing in the end, I gave a valiant effort and made some progress at least.   My experiences with Crusoe have sometimes been quite far from this. Whatever improvements or progress we have made has been immediately snatched away by random events. You build a shovel only for it to break. You build a fire only for rain to quench it. You find food only for you to swallow your own tongue. Then halfway through the game you realise that it is mathematically impossible for you to win anymore even if bad things stopped. And this can happen even if you play a perfect game. It just seems that it takes more to beat a perfect storm. Thus I have come to suspect you have to have all the stars align on the first couple of rounds to even have a slightest of chance of winning. If this is really true, it certainly is not a good thing that a 2-3 hour game is decided during the first 20 minutes but you still have play it till the bitter end.</td></tr><tr><td>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</td><td>121921</td>

I haven't yet decided if it's TOO hard, but it's close.

With shorter games, I don't mind losing fairly often because I have time to try again, but with a longer game like this one, I'd at least like to have a 50/50 chance of winning with competent play.  -The game feels highly chaotic and random.  Winning seems more about luck than good strategy. -The rulebook is terrible.  Very poor translation with lots of grammatical errors and typos.

I'd think that this was a fluke or a rule played wrong, but I think I've heard people talking about how many times they had to play, just to succeed once.  Possibly best as a solo game.

<td>6</td><td>United Kingdom</td><td>Terraforming Mars does have excellent fidelity to its theme; players are rewarded for warming and oxygenating the environment, and for placing lakes.    These activities also act as a clock, with the game ending when the planet is inhabitable.  There are alternative strategies around mining, settlement building, power generation and the greening of the planet.   The game's engine is tableau building and as tableau builders tend to be, it is pretty solitairish.  Interaction is limited to some minor take thatery.  Stop blubbing, it is minor.  As with other turn-based tableau builders, there is quite a lot of downtime.  In the one game I have played it seemed as though money just wasn't tight enough and the end game really dragged as those capable of raising the temperature instead chased the leader.  The hex map of the surface of Mars serves little purpose beyond corralling the players' developments.  The artwork has come in for some criticism; it is somewhat uneven.  Production quality is decent.</td></tr><tr><td>Terraforming Mars</td><td>167791</td>
<td>6</td><td></td><td>I love the theme of this game, the emphasis on raising the temperature and oxygen levels, and the forest, ocean and city building.  I give these elements a 9 of 10.   I also appreciate the "labor of love" feel of this game, crafting (and presumably balancing) all the cards, etc.     Having said that, for my gamer tastes, Terraforming Mars did not provide a particularly interesting or compelling gaming experience.  Virtually the entire game consisted of collecting and playing cards within the confines of my private player tableau.  Then, after we had built up our huge collections of cards, the game ended, and we tallied up the points.  During our game, the other players showed virtually no interest in my cards, and likewise, I showed no interest in their cards.  All in all, Terraforming Mars felt like it was about 95% multiplayer solitaire.  Admittedly, there are a lot of cards to read and think about, and as such, there are a lot of card combinations to ponder and potentially test out in future plays.  So, yes, if you like card combo games with lots of re-ployability, this could be a good game for you.  Unfortunately, I am not a card combo gamer, and I prefer much more player interaction in my games.  Having little interest in playing the game again, have to give it a 6.</td></tr><tr><td>Terraforming Mars</td><td>167791</td>
<td>6</td><td>Germany</td><td>Rating is for 2 player game only.  The game is fun but the endgame really drags with 2 players as it does not seem that the perceived leader can be caught up to. This leads to a weird, lopsided 'excitement against time' progression. Terraforming Mars is very intriguing and fun in the first couple of generations but gets less and less interesting the more global factors have been closed off, as many parts of your engine became more or less useless.  Probably a better (and shorter) game with 3 or more players</td></tr><tr><td>Terraforming Mars</td><td>167791</td>

<td>6</td><td>Poland</td><td>Played it once, a 3-player game. We felt it was an ok game, yet it overstayed its welcome. We played the shorter variant with advanced corporations, no drafting. So almost the simplest game, apart from the corporations and the initial purchasing of cards (which we did). Yeah... my fears about limited interaction turned out to be right. There's a big emphasis on your own engine optimization. There *is* interaction though, and it potentially may be significant with more experienced players: on the map, fights for milestones, awards or final opportunities for terraforming. We just felt that most of the time we weren't really interested in what cubes other players pushed left and right on their player boards. Interaction came close to the end. However the game lasted more than 2 hours, so we were a bit tired towards the end. Then we felt like there was a luck of draw. Could be fixed by the official drafting variant, but at the same time the game would drag even longer. Overall we think there are better games with limited interaction that we can play in shorter time, which we enjoy more at the same time: The Castles of Burgundy, Bruges and Suburbia came to our minds, they kind of scratch the same itch for us (although imo Suburbia has nice level of interaction, but it has that tableau building thing). With that said, it's a decent game, but there are so many better ones, so it's up for trade.</td></tr><tr><td>Terraforming Mars</td><td>167791</td>

<td>6</td><td>Germany</td><td>Der Zahnradmechanismus ist sch&#246;n. Aber leider verl&#228;sst sich das Spiel zu sehr darauf und verschenkt anderweitig sein Potenzial.  Z.B. die Geb&#228;ude und Monumente, die man baut, haben weder Bilder noch Namen, sind einfach lieblos gestaltete Siegpunktpl&#228;ttchen. Zudem spielen sie im Spiel keine weitere Rolle, bringen weder Vorteile, noch spielt die Anzahl/Kombination der Geb&#228;ude irgendeine Rolle. Somit geht zum einen der thematische Anstrich verloren, zum anderen ist es vom Spielgef&#252;hl her trocken, nur ein reines Siegpunkt sammeln anstatt etwas aufzubauen.  Ein weiterer Punkt ist, dass man gezwungen ist, sich, auf einen bestimmten Siegpunktpfad festzulegen, und dann ist der Rest des Spiel nur noch Rechnerei, um hier und da noch einen Punkt mehr rauszuholen. Das f&#252;hrt gegen Ende zu Gr&#252;belorgien. Es fehlt zudem auch an Spieldynamik und Flexibilit&#228;t.  Wirklich schade um den tollen Zahnradmechanismus, das h&#228;tte so leicht ein echter Kracher werden k&#246;nnen.  F&#252;r die ersten 1-2 Partien ist es trotzdem spannend, um den Zahnradmechanismus mal auszuprobieren, doch der schlecht konzipierte Rest verdirbt den Wiederspielreiz.

<td>6</td><td>Wales</td><td>There isn't anything very new here, except for the cog-turning, which isn't really a new mechanic - just a different presentation of things we've seen before in games like Village - i.e. workers increase their yield the longer they take over their task. The multiple routes to victory, buildings with production costs, and differing victory point generators, all feel like they were pulled straight from Ninjato, or Stone Age, or Walnut Grove, or any of a list of other worker placement games. It's quite a heavy implementation of the genre, and that might appeal to some - certainly heavier than all the afore-mentioned titles (except arguably Village). It looks great, but the theme doesn't really come through. All in all, it's an interesting resource-conversion, multi-player solitaire, puzzle, but there are many other choices if you want a game in this mould.  After a second play, I am even more disappointed in this game. It's a straight-up resource-conversion exercise, with no thematic integration at all. I convert grain into wood, to advance a step in an unspecified technology, which gives me additional wood, allowing me to build an un-named, un-illustrated "building", which gives me more grain. Rinse and repeat. I like dry, relatively themeless Euros, but this really is one step too far, and actually feels a little boring. The vast number of interconnected resources and action-spaces feel indulgent, and the whole thing is unwieldy - similar to another over-hyped, flabby, recent title, Bora Bora.   I have met many people who like this game, so there is clearly fun to be had here, and I won't turn down future games, but I won't be seeking it out.</td></tr><tr><td>Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar</td><td>126163</td>

Players must work together to explore various locations, occasionally interacting with NPCs and areas to find items that help solve the various puzzles, trying to best utilise their skills and overcoming deficiencies, all within time-track mechanism.    The artwork is evocative and compelling and the production quality is fantastic (as expected from Space Cowboys) but the constant stopping to read and paraphrase text detracts from the pace of the game.  There are also differences between the rules provided and the latest ones available on-line - pointing toward a lack of robust testing.  With each time run more information is gleaned that progresses the narrative, but each subsequent run devolves into a memory exercise, trying to recall what you did on the previous run to optimise your efforts within the available time.  Unfortunately each scenario is also a once-thru and some of the terminology doesn't quite gel (differences in translation, perhaps).    One piece of advice - take notes!  An modestly enjoyable gaming experience - but overall, it falls slightly short of being the deeply immersive experience I was hoping for.</td></tr><tr><td>T.I.M.E Stories</td><td>146508</td>

It was selling well throughout GenCon and I do expect it sold out. It plays very smooth and is very simple to run - which I appreciate alot. The theme is spectacular indeed. I love the look and feel here - a wintery apocalypse is richly thematic and evokes the tension needed for this type of co-op. I like the idea of possible betrayal in your own ranks - everybody gets a secret objective. The general play is everyone rolls dice and then goes out exploring locations by drawing up cards. Want more selection? Draw more cards - but that risks attracting more zombies. And why draw cards? To complete the crisis happening each round as well as beef up your characters.  The main touted feature here are the crossroads card. Conceptually, these are brilliant. Your neighbor draws one of these cards and if the event listed occurs during your turn, they read to you the results and you pick which happens. But I have a few problems with this. First, of the cards we drew, ALL but one of them pertained to specific characters in the game. Only once was the character in the game - so they didn't get triggered. When one did get triggered, it pertained to one of my characters - and it wasn't my turn. I was *reading* the card. Very strange feeling to have your character's decision determined by another player. It didn't feel thematic - just clumsy somehow. Another one was a set up of a fight in the colony - but we only had a single character there so it made no sense. Second, the consequence of the decision is revealed to the player - which feels very odd in play. I'd rather know the choices, but not the consequences. This all made me feel the crossroad cards were a missed opportunity.   That plus the rather repetitive play experience (search search search) left me a bit unimpressed. Don't take this for not enjoying the game - because I did and would gladly play again. But I didn't feel the need to buy it.</td></tr><tr><td>Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game</td><td>150376</td>

I waited until the time in which I had consecutive turns and quite easily sabotaged the group in a single turn and won.    The gameplay in general I though was quite fun, but as the betrayer I thought it was a bit easy to make the game go the hell very quickly.   12/2014 - After playing 3 times I really just don't see the appeal of this.  </td></tr><tr><td>Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game</td><td>150376</td>

<td>6</td><td>Finland</td><td>Down from 8 to 6. A fine game, but I've lost my interest in playing it. In the long run the fairly low replay value, long play time and WP player screwage are weighing it down.   Caylus is a brilliant design that epitomises the worker placement genre. At first glance it appears overwhelmingly complex, but there is a method to the madness and learning the mechanics and strategies is an interesting challenge. Once you do that, though, the game becomes an increasingly tedious and repetitive analysis-paralysis excercise.  Like most WP games, the main interaction comes from blocking other players and making mistakes is very costly. Caylus also has many mechanics that punish you for mistakes and by which the other players may screw you over. This can be very frustrating and causes serious AP issues as players try to calculate everything and avoid making a mistake while trying their best to calculate what others might be doing and how to wreck their plans.   The game is very long (too long!) and playing it makes me feel like I just ran a marathon. It is challenging and interesting in a masochistic way. The game experience is highly frustrating and the only times the suffering feels justified is when you win.   The iPhone app version is very well done. It has nice graphics and cuts the play time and bookkeeping down nicely. It still feels just as fiendishly frustrating to play as the original. Worth the money for everyone who enjoys the game. </td></tr><tr><td>Caylus</td><td>18602</td>

<td>6</td><td>Finland</td><td>Orl&#233;ans is a quite nice engine building game. You start with limited possibilities but continuously expand your horizons. I especially enjoyed that the game rewards long term strategies, i.e., at the start you choose the way you want to go and push it all the way through. This is really nice since you can make a great master plan, and then just try to execute it.  It seems that most strategies are more or less equally competitive meaning that the outcome will be decided on the tactical level. You need to phase your actions so that you always get what you need at the right time. Some strategies involve more direct competition with the opponents while others allow for you to fondle your own stuff mostly. This might be an issue especially with four players if three decide to race against each other while the fourth player can proceed at a pace of his own.  At first, you might think that the game would be awfully long with 18 full rounds. However, the 90 minutes playing time is actually quite true provided that everyone allocates their workers on action spaces simultaneously. I really think this is the only valid way to play, since 18 rounds would just be too long if everyone pondered every single move for a few minutes. The setup is a bit long, though.  One decision I did not fancy, though, was that all extra buildings are available right from the start. This creates an unnecessary vast decision tree and leaves novices and beginner level players flabbergasted. Moreover, it is easy to think of a tight game with experts who want to analyze everything very carefully and thus freezing the game due to too many options available.  In a nutshell, I enjoyed Orl&#233;ans but there is nothing exceptional to it. There are some (minor) issues with the vastness of the decision tree but you can adopt a strategy which allows you to take a more straightforward approach and ignore the tree completely.</td></tr><tr><td>Orl&#233;ans</td><td>164928</td>

<td>6</td><td>Poland</td><td>I liked the idea of the bag building mechanism, and even enjoyed the game for some time. However I do have a couple of issues with the game. First of all it overstayed its welcome. Everybody said it played a bit too long (2h with 3 players). 18 rounds turned out to be too long. At the beginning of the game you have many options, but can only do 1-2 actions a rounds. Later in the game you have a lot of capabilities, but a number of actions diminishes, which is irritating. On the other hand if it weren't for this aspect interaction would be even scarcer. And this smoothly leads us to the second problem. This is mainly a multiplayer solitaire. Hardly ever do you interact with other players. The map where you wander with your merchant is so big that all 3 players easily maneuvered over there. Only by the end of the game did we look at the Town's Hall to see whether somebody is about to snatch the citizen of the auxiliary board. Overall, I like euro games and indirect interaction, but this one lacked interaction even for my taste.  Overall, it was an ok game, but there are small chances it will hit the table again, there are simply better picks for this time span.

<td>6</td><td>Finland</td><td>The Voyages of Marco Polo will definitely appeal to everyone who like their nuts to be tough to crack. By this I mean that in the the game you experience an acute shortage of everything. You are always one resource, money or action short from executing all what you want. And this is not only at the end of the game, the pressure is constant. As a gaming experience this pressure translates to an unforgiving optimisation exercise of the use of resources and actions. You simply cannot afford to waste anything if you want to have that sensation of accomplishment. Should your steps stray from the optimal path you quickly find yourself in a deadlock from where there is no escape.   When it comes to other aspects of the game, I find it quite interesting. Dice as workers to place is a nice mechanic and forces you to adapt to a degree since you cannot plan everything ahead. But the best thing in my opinion are the strong special powers each character and city grants. They really seem to make a difference. This creates myriad of valid strategies which, from what I've experienced and heard, are quite well balanced. This is truly a great achievement. So many ways to play, so many ways to win, you just have to find your own niche where there is less competition. However, the strong powers also add to the need for heavy optimisation. One cannot forgo their powers, since generalists who do a little bit of everything will not excel. To make the best use of your powers you have direct your scarce resources on a single goal, while pessimised moves gain you nothing, absolutely nothing.  Marco Polo has a steep learning curve and provides a subject to study for a long time. I like puzzles and I like tough games. But I reckon The Voyages of Marco Polo might be best played online, although not in a live match. This is simply because the ruthlessness of the game does not reward casual play. Personally, I do not enjoy sloppy plays, but at the same time, I do not like being the person who is APing in the table. Similarly, I detest sitting in a table where one or several players are  not even trying to win or freeze all the time (admittedly I am often guilty of paralysing myself, so it won't be me throwing the first rock and thus I am not complaining too much).   A game that is has a very similar feel and tickles the same cell in your brains is Terra Mystica, IMHO.</td></tr><tr><td>The Voyages of Marco Polo</td><td>171623</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>With all due respect to the fans, I can't understand how this game is rated so highly.  Yes, it has _really_ good mechanisms (with one flaw IMHO) and offers diverse strategies, however all but one (or possibly two) of those strategies are _entirely_ pointless.  I can even overlook the fact that the character powers are significantly unbalanced, but what I can't overlook is that you can't compete (or even stay remotely close) unless you play primarily and heavily towards contracts - with one possible exception - and, to me, that makes for a pointless game.  As much as I liked the mechanisms, I'm in no hurry to play this again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.</td></tr><tr><td>The Voyages of Marco Polo</td><td>171623</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>"A story with Lovecraftian elements, not a Lovecraftian story" is rather apt, as is a comparison to Indiana Jones in that it's less horror and more worldly romp. I'm not after a game that is specifically an Arkham game, so much as that thematic universe. To that end, this fits marvelously well. Yes, you throw dice constantly (and it's that unfortunate form of "decide first, random after"), but thats not the point. Eldritch Horror is an interesting exploration game with a decent narrative and story (which was my driving factor); one where an actress go to the gym to work out (increase strength rolls) and then buy a double barreled shotgun to eradicate monsters and close gates or we're headed toward victory and then my partner's dark pact comes due, and she turns and stabs me (a reformed cultist) and feeds me to the monsters while she romps off to (a shared) victory. Somewhat group dependent; I didn't particularly feel there was much down time, but I valued the story that was created (even if it wasn't necessarily similar to the stories, ymmv). We read encounters to each other, only reading the bits that were relevant to tell the story and getting into character when possible. Music, lighting, and people getting into it is what really drives EH. To that end, it needs the first expansion to break up the limited cycling of cards (which really hurts the narrative aspect).   Overall, no regrets, even if it's not something I'd want to play constantly. In some ways, Mansions of Madness (2nd edition in particular) scratches a similar itch, but it's different. Comparatively, EH is less thematic in it's presentation and representation, includes less tension or intimacy with it's subject, but has the potential to be much more emergent than MoM2e does with it's limited (and driven) scenario count. Eldritch Horror has the serious potential to go the distance for tons of plays, where as MoM2e doesn't.  One of my strongest 6s/weakest 7s.</td></tr><tr><td>Eldritch Horror</td><td>146021</td>

Well, Eldritch Horror wasn't exactly what I expected. Setup was still quite a chore and the game didn't move all that fast. Or should I say that the game ended fast in terms of completed rounds, but the absolute time it took was quite long. I found it quite disappointing to see that I only managed to move from Panama to New York and then to San Francisco during the 3,5 hours. Oh, I loved the story, and actually celebrated when my character died, but I wanted to do more than just to collect two clues, buy a train ticket, get ambushed by a monster, get stabbed into forehead and wake up in a unfamiliar ditch without a recollection of the events night before.  In a nutshell, the story was enjoyable but I didn't feel that I actually contributed to the outcome of the game in any significant way. The proportion of story telling and book keeping to actual playing is way off its mark here. I would play again but I would never consider buying the game knowing that it wouldn't actually get any table time. Should I have a suitable slot in my calendar, Arkham Horror would be my pick, since it has almost the same playing time but you get to do more. </td></tr><tr><td>Eldritch Horror</td><td>146021</td>

<td>6</td><td>Greece</td><td>Another adventure game set in the world of Lovecraft. I liked the quality components and the cool artwork. The condition mechanic is a clever idea and works great.  Gameplay is quite simple. You just move on the board and draw a card to see what you found. The card instructs you to pass a test. So you roll a dice to see what happens.   Eldritch Horror is too simple for my taste. The game is supposed to be a cooperative one but I didn't see how you can actually help the other players. Also the card descriptions are too generic and didn't grab me. I expected that this game would tell me a story like Mansions of Madness where every card has a meaning and there is a story that makes sense. </td></tr><tr><td>Eldritch Horror</td><td>146021</td>

<td>6</td><td>Italy</td><td>[Vote and comment refer to the standard game, without variants of any sort] This game gives you everything you need to bring a great space saga on your table, however TI3 also offers a set of rules that in the end don't seem very well rounded, needing that last tweak or two to "click" properly.  A role selection model is functional if, depending on the situation, each and every role can become your best choice. That doesn't seem to be the case with TI3: having to choose a specific role (Imperial) every round or another specific one (Initiative) whenever the former isn't available is not metagaming, it's an engine that you have to kick every round to make it work properly. The balance among the strategy cards can also become a matter of debate, even considering the difficulties of trying to put together such a variety of contexts (commerce, political options, technological advancements). Playing time is too long and that, of course, is not a fault of the game per se, it's me (you have to rule over an entire galaxy, for Pete's sake, what was I thinking?). The objectives usually support the enforcing of your position without leading to open conflict, with a "cold War" feel that doesn't really fit with my idea of space combat. Please, use at least the Age of Empire variant, unless you want to wander pointlessly around the galaxy while you wait to know what can make you win the game. The command counters system has its own issues: production is coupled with movement, transfer actions are limited to two systems, the fact that command counters need their own economy adds much more problems than the ones they solve, not to mention the strange mix of aspects that they try to put together. I've decided to sell my goods and study some kind of new scientific gizmo, so I can't move my ships. REALLY? Other minor complaints include the balance of some units and the overall "patchwork" feel of the rules, which of course can be a minor flaw as long as everything works properly, but still makes the learning curve quite steep. On the other hand, if you're looking for an immersive experience, TI3 it's really up to the task with its (albeit sporadic) space battles, a complex technology tree, a bit of political role-playing, space exploration and almost everything else you could expect.  Most of all, it's like a space-opera kit that you can use to tailor the game to your tastes, and somewhere in there you could probably find your favourite, mind-blowing, don't-call-us-for-the-next-few-hours space civilization game. The Shattered Empire rulebook is definitely worth a look, because some of its tweaks are easily applicable to the base game even without the extra bits.  The box, the amount of bits and cards, the table you need to keep everything at hand and, of course, the hole in your wallet (made even worse if you consider the expansion): everything about this game seems to be huge. Huge props to FFG's customer service: I got a couple of badly molded units and they took care of the substitution quickly and for free, even if I'm on the other side of the pond. Great overall graphics for a very well implemented theme.  Good rulebook.</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)</td><td>12493</td>
<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>My initial thoughts after one game:  There is a lot to like about TI3. The components are awesome, the scope is enormous, the sheer amount of decisions and options is insane. That being said, after 1.5 hours of rules and 6 hours of gameplay, I didn&#8217;t feel like I did much of anything.  I was never able to move more than 2-3 tiles away from my home system. It would take two whole rounds (or three!) to really move your fleet, which is to say, 2-3 hours of game time. I was involved in only a couple battles, during which my entire fleet was wiped out. Except in one case where my wife destroyed another player in a battle, war seemed to cripple both players rather than help the winner advance &#8211; meaning it was more trouble than it was worth.   The downtime also increased exponentially with each hour of the game. At one point near the end I went over 30 minutes without being involved in the game at all. Also, scoring VP is kind of baffling. I don&#8217;t think anyone had a realistic Secret Objective they could achieve (all had to do with controlling a laughable number of planets and/or Mecatol Rex) and the ISP was only chosen sporadically, so Public Objectives didn&#8217;t really come out until hours 4, 5 and 6.  The sheer length of the game is troubling considering that it takes so long to do anything. I suppose I should have researched it more, but I thought with the high rating on BGG and it being a 6-8 hour game that you would be doing a ton of stuff in an epic space opera. In reality it felt more like Sid Meier's Civilization, the board game, in space (a game I'd be content never to play again). I own and have played Empires of the Void several times, and I feel like I do much more in that game in a total game time of two hours than I ever felt in 6+ hours of TI3.  And yet, despite my misgivings, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the game in the days since. It looks like the expansion and variants like Age of Empires fixes most of the issues I have with it (the snail&#8217;s pace at the beginning, limited chances for VP, rewards turtling over warfare). I would try it again, but I would prefer to do so using a variant that fixes some of the base game&#8217;s many issues. </td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)</td><td>12493</td>

It's akin to going out to a really expensive dinner - you do it once a year or so on special occasions, but it's too rich and thick for regular consumption. Too heavy and long for my gaming group - which is a shame because I think I'd play it more often otherwise. </td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)</td><td>12493</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>*Rating based on one play.  TI3 was on my gaming "bucket list", a list of well-regarded or popular games that I want to play at least once.  Now that I've crossed TI3 off that list, I'm not sure that I'll ever return to it.  It's not that I disliked TI3, it's just not a game in my wheelhouse.  TI3 is a long, heavily thematic and interactive game, while I prefer shorter, multiplayer solitaire style Eurogames.  Putting genre biases aside (as much as possible), what did I think of TI3?  I would have to say it is one of the better "dudes on a map" games I have played, head and shoulders above the likes of Risk or Axis and Allies.  I like that you have means of being peaceful in the game (though I think winning is impossible if you don't take the gloves off at some point), and I like that players can interact in non-military ways, through trade and politics.  I like the technology tree system, though I would have liked to see each species have its own tree.  The graphics and bits are all quality, though the graphical design of the rulebook shows its age.  I like that the game's end goal is objective-based, and not simply "eliminate all opponents".  That said, I'm not sure I like how the objectives are handled in the game.  In my one play, I found I was usually able to score an objective the turn after it came up.  I even scored my personal, secret objective fairly early, which may have been a rookie mistake as it painted a big bullseye on my head.  When an objective came up that didn't seem achievable, I was left in a sort of holding pattern, not really having a clear direction to go.  When the next objective that came up was simply a more difficult version of the previous, I again felt directionless.  The galaxy was so crowded at that point that any attempt at territorial gains would result in a swift counterattack and could have left me open to losing much of my empire, so the game devolved into a sort of trench warfare where I was simply trying to maintain my borders and hoping the next objective to come up would be achievable.  It made the last third of the game an uninteresting slog.  Even the other players seemed relieved when the game finally ended after some 8 hours.  In the end, I'm glad to have experienced the game, but I don't know that I'll ever come back to it.  I've rated it a 6 as it is a mechanically solid game with a lot of things to like about it, and if it played in just an hour or two, I'd be willing to play it again.  But as an all-day kind of game, I'm not sure I'd want to come back to it.  It's just not my cup of tea.</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)</td><td>12493</td>

It's definitely vastly superior to 2nd Ed in my opinion, and I do enjoy the game more since it became more about diplomacy than piles of cruisers. Managing the counter balance on the player mats is particularly fun, but the game still takes a bit too long to finish for my liking (I'd prefer to play 3/4 shorter games). *edit* Revised my rating after further plays. The Imperial thing really annoys me since there are a number of action cards that can put you right out of the game from turn 1. *edit* a member of our group got the expansion, so this may go up in score once we play it </td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)</td><td>12493</td>

Don't get me wrong, playing Patchwork is actually fairly enjoyable, especially when you are in the mood to play something "relaxing", so to speak. It allows you to play an engine building game without a huge number crunching and the complexity typical of these kinds of games. Still it's also very repetitive and it gets old pretty quickly, therefore I really don't understand how this game got to number 38 on the general ranking on BGG. I don't usually care so much about these sort of things, but I really believe that this game is overrated by the community here.  While there's nothing really wrong with Patchwork as a design, there are much better 2-player games on the market right now.

Roll is a clever implementation of the action selection and tableau building of Race using dice and tiles.  On brief acquaintance, the luck of the dice seems about the same as the luck of the cards; the dice have plenty of wild results and several developments offer the power to re-arrange them. Nonetheless, I prefer the speed and simplicity of choosing an action card over rolling arranging and re-arranging a bunch of dice.  Ultimately, I don't think that Roll improves on Race, nor does it offer me a significantly different experience.  However, gamers without my baggage may find Roll the more accessible game.

The art and presentation are excellent, Days of Wonder, so no surprise. The Djinns are all unique and interact with the board in interesting ways.  2nd play: The game plays quite differently with 3 than with 2. It's more tactical with 3, and AP could bog the game down. It didn't in my group, but I have to be very careful who I play this game with. It doesn't live up to the hype, but very few games could. A good game I'm happy to play.</td></tr><tr><td>Five Tribes</td><td>157354</td>

<td>6</td><td>Canada</td><td>A very nice blend of strategy and tactics; you do need both!   It's essentially a victory-point salad sort of game, and filled with AP; but it's not a long game, so the AP is endurable.  My only major complaints are about the art and presentation. First of all, I fear Five Tribes may present some challenges to the colour-blind; and the similarities between the appearances of the various non-meeple wooden pieces make it difficult even for those who happily live in a kaleidoscope. The artwork on the djinn cards is beautiful....and the art everywhere else is fairly bad! It's hard to believe it was all done by the same artist.</td></tr><tr><td>Five Tribes</td><td>157354</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>1st Play: This game felt a lot like wings of war, which make sense given they're the same system. The pacing feels off, with a round of combat followed by 2 rounds of maneuvering just to have another round of misses. The miniatures and production are top notch, the game just isn't as smooth as I would like. I'm also not a miniatures player, so I might not be the right audience for this.   No 2nd play: Not that I'll never give this game a chance, but I'm not enough of a Star wars fan (or any mini's game) to really get into a system like this. It's well produced and the theme is excellent, just not for me.</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game</td><td>103885</td>
<td>6</td><td>Australia</td><td>Slick.   Everything about this is a promise fulfilled in terms of the big-company, big-license game. Finally FFG gets the little things right: the rules are finally at-standard, the fans get their 'realism' and the game doesn't drown in superfluous components.   The game is just fun, fun, fun. It's accessible (which Wings of War is not, strangely). It's fast (not only a 20-30 minute game, but turns move fast). It's got enough skill and granularity to keep you interested.   Unfortunately, I gave up on it when it seemed like you needed a tonne of ships and playspace to make the to-and-fro interesting. If you want a customisable minis game, I think this is worth it, but if you want an affordable board game, might be too much $$$.</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game</td><td>103885</td>
<td>6</td><td>Singapore</td><td>A very good remix version of wings of war. The minis are really great looking and decent in size.   Game play is easy for both beginners and some complexity for intermediate gamers alike.  Like Wings, this game suffers a bit from the 2D-3D space representation. In that sense, the game lack that dimension to move those ships in combat.  As a wave by wave collectable, it makes the spending less painful.  Good introductory game</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game</td><td>103885</td>

A fun worker placement game, although I'd probably pick Caylus over this one.  ---  Another play in and this one's rating is already starting to drop.  Unlike other worker placement games that I've played, this one only seems to have one path to victory (complete quests).  As such, Lords of Waterdeep turns into an optimization game of who can complete their quests in the most efficient manner.  Compare this to Caylus or Agricola where players can get points through a variety of means.  Waterdeep is a game that I probably won't turn down, but will never suggest to play.</td></tr><tr><td>Lords of Waterdeep</td><td>110327</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>A typical worker placement Euro with an Ameritrash theme pasted on.  It plays well, but doesn't have anything original about it.  Those who dislike direct conflict will be turned off by the Intrigue cards, some of which can be used to directly attack opponents.  UPDATE: After a second play, I've lowered my rating a half point because I feel like there is too much luck involved in the game with regards to Quest cards and Intrigue cards.  Drawing the right Quest cards to match with one's Lord card plays too big a factor for my liking, and it's a largely random factor.  Sure, there are ways to bury Quest cards that other players may need, but taking an action to set back a single opponent at some cost to yourself is a net loss for you in games of 3+ players.  The same is true of the Mandatory Quests.  Playing a Mandatory Quest on one player doesn't affect any other players, and costs you an Intrigue card play.  All in all, it's an okay game, but a bit too random and confrontational to make a good Euro game.  +Fun theme that may appeal to those turned off by the usual Euro game themes. +Nice gateway to Euro-style games. +Easy to learn.  -Lots of direct attacks on other players. -Possibility of king-making. -Large degree of randomness involved in Quest cards.</td></tr><tr><td>Lords of Waterdeep</td><td>110327</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>People talk about how they want a replacement or reimplementation of Arkham Horror and the common answer is Eldritch. I think that's incorrect for a series of reasons, but mostly because MoM2e fits much better in terms of why people don't like EH as a replacement (it's a fine game, but it's different). MoM2e requires you to engage monsters, there are more consequences, the tension ratchets up as folks become deranged or damaged since there is no easy/consistent way of healing. The Mythos phase is something everyone fears much more. It's much more confined and almost claustrophobic in feel compared to EH's more worldly romp. In short, it's a Lovecrafting experience more so than EH is in many ways. The app is rather slick, even if you do spend a lot of time "heads down" in the app instead of engaged in the board or with other players.  I think some things really annoy me about the game though, the inability to heal is thematic, but an annoyance. That I get pegged by the Mythos phase *and* have to do a horror check against critters makes sense, but sort of sucks as you spend all of this time beating on stuff just to avoid gaining gobs of horror. I sort of regret basing the minis, but really, this is a game where the minis are super clunky but sweet (and helpful in terms of narrative as they are imposing with bases, and it makes the rooms crowded) to look at on the board... A real storage solution would help, I guess if I was willing to dedicate a suitcase or a ginormous wad of plick-n-pluck and build something... Last, even for an Ameritrash-style game, it's on rails courtesy of the scenario-driven system and as such, once you play through a scenario two, maybe three times, it falls flat (e.g. you know you have X turns until a critter spawns here, and you know what information an NPC is going to give you).  For a thematic experience though, it's hard to beat, but I come away from playing with a sour taste in my mouth for some reason, I don't know. I waffle on a 6 or 7; I want to play it again, but the scenario I've had trouble with is more of a "do I really think I can beat this" mechanical exercise anymore... In some ways, it should be a 2 strike system ala Pandemic:Legacy; if you can't get it after 2 (maybe 3) tries, then move on as the very thing that it excels at (theme) falters with repeated play...</td></tr><tr><td>Mansions of Madness: Second Edition</td><td>205059</td>

<td>6</td><td>United Kingdom</td><td>Random elements make this game feel more like a ride than something you can influence and control. The app has sound effects and voice talent BUT it is concentrated in the first few turns of the first scenario and is more or less missing from the rest of the scenarios!   I feel that the app should have more sound effects for monsters and much more varied music, perhaps even procedurally generated sequences to heighten tension.  The price of this game is extremely high and it isn't great value in my opinion. If I didn't already have first edition and the expansions I would've given this a miss entirely on the basis of prohibitive cost.  Having said all that I have had a blast with this game, it is simple enough to entice non gamers and has just enough meat on the bones for veterans too. The pricing structure for future scenarios will dictate whether this stays in my collection or not. </td></tr><tr><td>Battlestar Galactica</td><td>37111</td>

The only reason this doesn't get higher marks is because my interest in point salads is waning. I like games which have a more streamlined focus on what you are trying to do, which is perhaps why train games and abstracts have risen in my estimation.  Still want to give this some more plays to see if familiarity with the buildings, conversion chains, and resource chokepoints brings the underlying game theory into clearer focus. </td></tr><tr><td>Fields of Arle</td><td>159675</td>

<td>6</td><td>United States</td><td>Viticulture Essentials presents a streamlined package of the previous Viticulture/Tuscany.  It is smooth and quick with fantastic components and the usual Stonemaier attention to detail.  It is also still swingy and random enough to be unsatisfying at times.  To be fair, I'm not big on race games.  This is a good race game but I'd likely choose other race games (Steampunk Rally, for example) and would DEFINITELY choose Vinhos over this any day for a wine theme.  Once the new Tuscany board is available again, that'll likely improve things.</td></tr></tbody></table></section></div></body></HTML>`;
