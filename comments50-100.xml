    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">Laughably broken (we were literally laughing at how bad this game is): the Forces of Sauron just stroll over the Fellowship time and again, game after game ("Want to see that again? There. Again? There....).  How can you NOT laugh?!</comment>
    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="United States">151117  Rating just the Merlin mechanic.  I really hate it now in minds eye.  You don't play a bleeping game just to have it end on coin flip.  130923 This rating might go up in the future if I ever get bored with plain resistance.  However, until then, the Merlin mechanic is somewhat problematic.  It kind of ends the game with a 1/X chance of not losing. Furthermore I have participated in a couple games where it was almost ruined by a premature reveal of the merlin or other characters. I just prefer the basic asymmetric (if its real) balance of plain resistance.</comment>
    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="Finland">Never again. Played multiple games but still doesn't know what to do at all. I just picked targets by spinning the marker and but my reject card away and just aproved everything.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="Norway">Drawn-out and repetitive. I'm not fond of worker placement games in general, but this is much worse than any other I've played. For me this game is extremely dull.</comment>

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">There are soooo many cool things you could do with a train game.  Think about it: you could have dinosaurs drive those trains.  You could have lasers mounted on your trains.  You could have Johnny Cash in it.  Any of which would be so cool, you couldn't HELP but to get a 10 rating out of it.  So what do we do?  We create a crappy Euro with your typical moronic Euro-theme.  My city turns out, let's say, TVs.  My TVs are popular, so I sell out of all of them.  What do I do?  I borrow money so that I can expand my production and make MORE TVs, right?  No.  I STOP SELLING THEM!  I ran out of cubes.  I can't make any more.  How much pot does one have to smoke in order to believe this?  Seriously?    Look, I can work with some things: let's say the dinosaurs on my train hopped off and rampaged through your city, eating everyone in sight and using their laser guns to destroy every TV.  Let's say Johnny Cash got tired of hearing that whistle blowing, so he led a prison breakout at Folsom and they looted your city and stole your TVs.  Fine.  THAT, I can work with (and admit it: both options would be so awesome).    But no, we don't do that.  We move our cubes from city to city and collect monopoly money and pay off our mortgages, or some type of Euro-crappy-nonsense.  And worst of all, unlike your typical 45-minute Ticket to Ride-type of Euro that has nothing to do with anything, you are on the hook for a few hours with this turd.  So much you could do with a train theme. :shake:  FAIL.</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Absolutely hate the theme</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Not a big fan of area control; but the theme is what killed it for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Why is the title of this game in BGG not Warhammer:  Chaos of the old world.  ???  Anyway.  Horrible game.  Played with the expansion. All 5 of us were frustrated and miserable at the same time.  I'd say a game has missed its mark when no-one is having fun. </comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United States">120909 I do NOT like ANY of the added mechanics in the game.  I don't mind the locmotive required gray route but nothing else recommended the game to me.  In fact I may bump up my TtR America rating due to this play of Europe.  The game itself was ok, but its best use is to highlight how clean and elegant the original was.  I could be talked into playing it again, but I would strenuously push for the original.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="Canada">Nothing wrong with game. I'm sure its a splendid affair. However after watching run through and or reading reviews, absolutely no desire to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="Ireland">Looks quite fun. Interested to check it out.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">Never before have I played a game where so little of the game created a narrative/story, I had so little choice in what I could do, yet was dumped on so much (and still won). I often found myself having cards leeched out of my hands by others, but no opportunity to draw new cards, participate in encounters, or even the simple consolation prize of choosing who to target for retribution when it was my turn. There is nothing that would make me play this again.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Singapore">A math game for all I see, appeal to those who likes such games. definately not a chill out game for wargamers.  Felt that 1st and 2nd player always have an edge over others. </comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="">Have you ever wondered to yourself "I wish I knew what it would be like to run every single aspect of a European farm and feel just as exhausted and bored by it as it sounds?" Well have I got the game for you!</comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">JASE. I think a cake bakery would have been a better theme. OK first you get chocolate chip cookies. If you make enough of those, you get to make muffins! "Flesh" rails? o_O</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">I absolutely did not enjoy this game at all. The asymmetric game play is completely broken and luck drive, the fact heroes could revive each other on the spot made for a very broken combat system. I would be more likely to leave a table this comes onto than to go to a table it is on.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="Germany">Neither fish nor flesh (aka: Wargame or Eurogame). Feels like being driven by the game-system and not by the players. For me too much based on the "draw the right cards at the right time" syndrom. And I hate having a rulebook + x pages of errata + x pages of FAQ. Looks like every rule has at least two exceptions. Didn't work for me. </comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="Germany">The advantage of the 2nd player is just to much to make it a really good game. The mechanics are quite nice but the imbalance between the positions keeps it from reaching a decent score.</comment>
    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Romania">Too long for what it is:  - Very harsh, inflexible game play.  - Limited strategies, little replay value.  - Most of the battles are decided by the flip of a single card.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Spain">Economic Area Control Euro Game. It's a great game, but it's not for me. I almost win but I got bored all the way.  Played once</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="Spain">99% luck, no decisions, only the cards to buy, art work it's cool, but the game it's very boring. Clearly overrated... Omg..</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">Not fun. At the beginning there is a nice slow build up, but then it just seems to go nuclear on a dime. In most games I have played, rather than there being a back and forth and a close finish, one player is able to put together a monster turn for an ungodly amount of damage and wipe the other player out. While this is completely within the rules, it feels kinda unsatisfying, even for the winner. It is more of a sense of "oh, I guess that just happened" shrug, rather than a sense of accomplishment from victory. it just seems to me that in the mid-rounds is when a deck-builder should be hitting it's sweet spot (you having fun with a lot of combos or moves from the cool deck you have built) this one will end abruptly.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="Australia">There were more choices than I thought - but just as little control over the outcome.   Effectively, this is a game about pacing - you try to either ramp up your spending to acquire more efficient threats or you cash in and go into all out attack mode. Unfortunately, the 'drafting' row - of only five cards - doesn't allow you to craft much strategy, and quite frankly, doesn't even allow you to be positive tactically enough of the time.   I think Ascension, online, was worth some play to learn the limitations of a fun set, but this is the same deal, but the online implementation is weaker.   The shuffling would be a big problem if I played this in real life. </comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="">Terrible theme, terrible artwork (the subject matter and the visual components are simply disgusting) with insipid dice-driven mechanics to round off the unpleasant experience and that's how I rate a game a 2.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Finland">Long and boring. Never again.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United Kingdom">I don't get why people rave about this game, I played it twice and found it awfull both times. The game seems to have too many elements too it and is over complicated. It also appeared to have balance issues and I found the way the game plaed to be terrible, it was all decided on the last turn really  I like the warhammer fluff, but let it stay in books</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Canada">Group played this once. Reached the end of the game and were all so bored with it we didn't even bother to finish scoring. Hasn't seen the light of day since.</comment>

    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">Um, well, I keep coming back to my Go books trying to get my head around this game.  I think I'm getting closer to being able to try playing -- it's just that after a few thousand years it seems nobody's come up with a simple way of telling us newbies how to know when the game is over.  It is a beautiful game, and it has stood the test of time...but I just don't see that much too it....</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="Canada">Go, I wanna like ya. I think you're purtty. And so smart, too.  But you ain't got NO sense of humour:  You are always so mean to me, Go.  How come I always get things so wrong, ever' time I approach you?  From the way you treat me, I can see that your middle and last names are too offensive to be written in a polite setting like this. And so, I must go, Go. From now on, you are Went to me.  :( </comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">The Good: It's a really thinky game; getting the mancala to do what you want, budgeting appropriate time levels, figuring out how to milk each area to your advantage. The Bad: It's a bunch of mini-games bolted onto the core mancala action selection mechanism. Not a lot of theme connections in that regard. The Ugly: There is almost zero player interaction, if someone runs away with the game, you have to hope they screw up because coming back is woefully hard once that player figures out how the milk the mancala for what it's worth. Plays best at 4p as time management becomes more critical and the rest of the mini-games become more contested. I found I liked the game until I figured out what made it tick, then the shine wore off.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Dry as dust.  And I love Roman themed games.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Portugal">Workman placement + workman placement + workman placement  and ...  workman placement. Advance on track A, get some bonus and then advance on track B and ... puf Be smart and Get fast on the right track and you will win a Bonus and get 100 VPs! and that without any kind of luck!!  No theme at all, only boring and dejavu mechanics.  I can&#180;t understand why people don&#180;t get tired of "playing" this kind of exercise.  I should rethink my presence in these euro sessions.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">Yet another derivative worker placement game, although here everyone scores over 300 points, with half of them coming on the last round. Blecch. The game board looks as if it was designed by the Mad Monk himself. </comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="United States">I really enjoy Sherlock stories and mystery solving games. This game is ok to play if you completely ignore the scoring system and the supposed solution. This is one time play through but it comes with a good number of stories making it worthwhile.   The main problem comes with the solution to the game. No real evidence is given, just conjecture and you need to come up with a story that would fit. I find that we can come up with a solid story that works perfectly when we play through the game but is wrong simply because sherlock says it is. The game needs some sort of evidence you can obtain or a way to get a confession without having to just use conjecture to solve it.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="Norway">Played twice. So far I don't quite see why some of my friends hold this game in such high regard. But since it is a friendly and relaxing coop experience I'm glad I have it in my collection. Rules are easy to teach. What worries me so far is the apparent lack of depth. I didn't get a sense of having interesting choices when playing. What to do and when seemed rather obvious. But that might very well change after some more plays.  Edit: Some more plays has confirmed my earlier worries. Both my wife and I consider the game rather pointless. There is little strategy, and thus victory or failure is mostly a matter of luck, not tactics or skill.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="Spain">Traded I like the theme and the board and components are beautiful.

    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="Canada">I don't get why people like and rave about this game. Sure you can accommodate a group of 10, but that's about all this game has going for it. Pretty boring overall. Even my non-gaming friends were like "What? This is it?". Do you need to be drunk to enjoy this one? Why is this so popular? Why?!?!</comment>
    <comment game="Crokinole" game_id="521" location="Canada">A completely dull dexterity game. Go bowling or play some shuffleboard instead.  Some people find fancy crokinole boards appealing. I just find them large and hard to put away. </comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="">Arbitrarily complicated VP conversion game... ugh. The dice market was cool, but spending hours jumping through the very arbitrary-feeling hoops to turn X into Y into Z iinto victory points was just blegh. I would take Puerto Rico any day over Troyes</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">151117 Hmm this seems to be an evergreen title even if its hit classic status.  Maybe I'll give it a second shot someday.  120909 Meh.  I'm not a fan of worker placement so it doesn't work for me.  The dice do not add an interesting diversion.  I prefer the austere elegance of Caylus which currently is the only worker placement game I enjoy.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Cyprus">I am quite puzzled by the fact that most people can't see past the deduction screen and realise that this is a bad and very random worker placement game. </comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Germany">What a depressing experience.   On the good side: the theme is very interesting and funny, the mechanics and fluff go welltogether. Also, at first sight, the illustrations are quite nice. The app works as intended, with a little fiddling even in low light.  But on the bad side, where do I start? It's basically some kind of single-player deduction game with a tacked on board game to force player interaction limited to "I want to do the same thing you do but I cannot", a ton of unintuitive rules, way too many components. It is a big mess. Feels as if there was the App and then they built a game around it and did not care about making it even slightly elegant.  It takes ages to explain, but there is not a lot of complexity, mostly it's just complicated. :(  Easily the most overhyped game of 2014. </comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Not a fan of the Legendary system or of Horror films.  Not likely to play this one again.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">I felt like there was no mechanic or part of the game that really appealed to me. Sometimes having the lack of options because no cards of the type you wanted coming out felt a little odd.</comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Suburbia falls into a series of categories that all reinforce each other and that Castles of Mad King Ludwig largely resolves (for me personally); I don't get a particularly strong theme from it because all of the tiles are sort of generic. It's an engine management game, and isn't particularly interactive. I was willing to play until the tablet edition came out, and now that I can bang out a game in 15 minutes or less against the AI (or in 30min with a pass and play against the spouse), I don't have any interest in the cardboard game. To compound matters, I'm not particularly interested in the app all that much anymore. I get the appeal, it's just not a game for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">Too many absurb situations in this game. The Middle East is made far too important in achieving victory.Also getting the United States involved in the war is rarely a goal the allies pursue. Any similarity between this game and The Great War is purely coincedental.</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United Kingdom">I knew this was like Age of Steam and I had to get my arm twisted to play it. And I disliked it just like AoS. Incredibly dry.  Zero fun. A brain-burner. The best thing about the game was moving the train-shaped turn marker. Luckily I was sat at that corner of the board so I got to do that 6 times. It took nearly 4 hours to play (5 players) but no-one seemed to be taking too long to take their turns.  A large amount of downtime, but arguably you need it to think about your next turn. Life is too short to play games like this. And this is when I won.</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United States">An econ train game where the movement of goods functions in the polar opposite from how I see it logically playing out (where as you want to move them to the nearest port of business) in that you move goods the most inefficient chain possible to score the most points (compared to Indonesia where you pay per hop which makes sense). In that regard, my plays always felt sort of backwards in the analysis; I want track to go lots of places, but I don't want to move the goods there easily (but I do want to move the goods). An interesting puzzle, but not one that really holds my attention compared to other econ games. The digital version doesn't hold my attention after 9 or 10 plays, and plays in a fraction of the time as the cardboard copy...</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United Kingdom">Strip out the auction phase and you have an exercise from a business training manual on maximising income... that takes two hours+...and you're completely on your own.  How much fun does that sound?</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United Kingdom">At heart, Viticulture is a standard worker placement and engine building game with some decent wine industry theming.   You will want to recruit workers early and balance the grape growing and wine making processes with the need to earn cash and to develop your winery.   I found nothing particularly novel or engaging in any of this.  What poisons Viticulture's vines for me is the luck of the visitor and order cards.   Some will give your engine a real boost straight away and others will not.  Sure, you can draw more, but this is an efficiency game and drawing more just isn't efficient.    Artwork and production quality are both very good.  The distinctive pieces for each building type are a particularly nice touch.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Australia">Terribly disappointing. Love the theme, but our four player game was an exercise in frustration with way too many instances of everything useful being blocked.  Also, some of the cards were ludicrously beneficial in comparison to the uselessness of others.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="Belgium">Huge commercial push throughout the internet to sell a boardgame version of the video game League of Legends.

The usual commercial stuff with a huge box, plastic and a bigger campaign than Trump. No thanks.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="Canada">This game seems to be about enjoying the experience instead of winning, but I don't enjoy the screw your neighbour experience and that leaves little to recommend this game.

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United Kingdom">Only played this twice and I am just pulling out of the 'hate curve' of this game.  Maybe its just because I was the only newbie playing in games full of unhelpful sharks, but this seems to be a killer game to be a newbie in.  Expect it to be painful.   Update: played for the 3rd time and I just don't find this game fun.  It doesn't click with my brain the way it does with some people and I find that a huge amount of mental effort is required to play well - and I just can't be bothered.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">This game is a tough one to rate. It works as written (rules are a bit foggy but the FAQ's clear that up) but as written, it's a hostile, unforgiving, math-heavy game. This isn't a typical railroad game which moves at a leisurely pace and feels a bit like multi-player solitaire. Get 4+ players and this game is nasty and strategically difficult. Hardly a smile cracks anyone's face for nearly 4 hours of play. And when it's all over, your back hurts from leaning over the map  and your mind is fatigued from going through turn after turn of excruciatingly difficult economic decisions. So is this a good or bad game? Gaming can be an enjoyable time socializing, munching and playing a game or it can be "serious face" time where bathroom breaks are infrequent and every difficult decision adds another gray hair. The question is: how do you want to spend your leisure time?  See the GLG variants which help make the game a little more forgiving and a bit more friendly. Oh, and play Volldampf if you can find a copy.    After several plays, my original opinions stand and my rating has even gone lower. The game simply isn't any fun. It's a great mental exercise like multi-player chess but there isn't any real railroading flavor to this game. Plus, it has the problem of "runaway leader." You can't play cooperatively to stop someone. And even more problematic, if a player starts in a bad position (maybe gets cut-off early) then its basically game over for him as he'll limp along for the rest of the game. That's a game balance problem. And then there's the wait...calculate...wait...calculate... style of gameplay.   Honestly, if it was a choice between spending an extra half day at work or playing this game, it would be a difficult decision. </comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">This was the most frustrating and painful game I've ever "played."  It was like when you are a small child and your mother gives you some vile medicine -- you know that it's probably good for you, but that doesn't make it enjoyable.  From your very first move, you are in "the hole" and it's next to impossible to climb out.  Just painful, and mind you, I won!</comment>
    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">Raw, unadulterated engine building. Something about this makes me want to play this over Dominion and I think it's because of the chips, not necessarily the game play (as there is at least a planning element for each turn in Dominion, and it uses the random draw, both of which are missing in Splendor, but Splendor takes like half the time). Maybe because it's quicker, or more attractive, dunno.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">I played the "mocha" version, with a game board of 20 spaces, each with a different option-- far too many for my taste.

I suspect the basic version would be less complex and I might rate it a bit higher, but a different theme on a 3 x 3 (9 spaces) board would likely work a lot better for me. </comment>

I'm not a huge fan of economic resources-to-VP style euros, although this is probably the least unpleasant of the ones I've played. I might like it more if it actually played out in the advertised 60-90 minutes rather than the 180 minutes of hell my first game of this was... but I probably wouldn't want to risk the time on trying it again when I already have a half-dozen excellent and beloved games in the 2+ hour range that I'd rather play.   I was originally going to call this an exquisitely crafted, finely-tuned, well-polished turd, but there's actually a decent game in there. It just takes way too much time and effort to extract that decent game.  Game owners, do yourself a favor, sticker your meeples before introducing others to this game, because nobody with stubby gamer fingers wants to start game night with a delicate 20 minute arts-and-crafts project. It just set a tone of "doing tedious things" that never really left when I played this game.   Not an awful game but it just rubs my brain in the wrong way -- I have to go against all of my INTJ intuition to play it, and it makes it sort of mentally unpleasant. </comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Trajan is an interesting Feld game that is the definition of brain-burner. Unfortunately, I felt like I was struggling against the game the entire time. The pieces felt disparate, and though I pursued a strong military strategy, I was destroyed in the Forum and finished almost forty points behind my father-in-law.  Ultimately, I felt like I was playing 12 different mini-games rather than a single cohesive whole. The rondel element was extremely difficult and ultimately one of the best parts of the game -- I'd love to see that rondel mechanic spun off into its own game. Alternatively, I've heard of games (like Seeland) that use the rondel mechanic more effectively.   Recommended if point salad is your thing. It's not mine. </comment>

Instead of heroicly fighting monsters you're supposed to ignore them while they hit you and just run to square X in time.  The overlord doesn't send monsters to fight but to block the way for the heroes, so he can buy enough time to get to square Y.  Miserable line-of-sight rules.

The blocks as they are feel precisely like the weird miniatures replacement compromise that they were included for.  I really dislike the way the dice system interacts with the VP system. You play to a very small number of victory points, but the game doesn't value them properly. There are 1/36 chances to eliminate stuff like light cav and leaders outright, and you are awarded VP for it. It might be realistic, but it pretty much ruins the game for me. Killing a light cav on turn two with ranged units on a low probability shot could be 25% of the necessary VP. It's too random to be enjoyable.</comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Germany">This game for me has some major weaknesses: The supply - rules are a bad joke - a single Corps unit can kill 3 full strength armies by just cutting the supply lines. There is no breakout - attempt - nothing. The armies just sit there until the end of the turn then vanish into non-existence.  This is more a game of "move your units to certain places and win" covered in the mantle of WW1 - would work without a theme (this is not meant positive). They call it the "Dance of Death" - it is just an ongoing thing of trying to put the other units OOS - even without any fights - until one looses a 50-50 die-roll or can't move anymore.  Card-play is VERY scripted - especially for the Allied player who has not a lot of choices if he won't fall back w/o recovering. Especially the first hand for the Allied player decides an early demise. He has to go for Limited War (and therefore cripple himself on Replacements) or falls way back and gets crushed by a CP juggernaut. This is not "having decisions" as in a game like "Wilderness War".    I can't understand what people like on this game - for me it is an absolute waste of time with a high frustration level for the Allied player. The games I observed did not even see Total War - they were done at least after 7 - 8 turns by a German Victory or an Allied player giving up frustrated.      Update: Finished my next PoG game and lost again (Turn 1): CP played Guns of August, pressed hard on the front with constant attacks and, after taking Cambrai, put Verdun, Nancy and Belfort, with all of its armies OOS and therefore eliminated them since the French did not have the power to fight back.  I don't get this game - to me it looks totally unbalanced. In a strategy guide I read that a French Player should instantly attack Strasbourg from Nancy. The French have an attack of 6, the CP a 5 Army plus a 3 fortress. Even if the French succeeds, and the CP withdraws, moving one army into Strasbourg leaves Nancy wide open?!   Final thoughts: After five consecutive plays I have to say that this game is not for me. The most annoying thing for me is that the game "works" on the base of "lack of concentration" on one players side. One short moment of not 100 % in the game lets you miss the move of a small Corps that puts your armies OOS. Its like chess where you wait for your opponent to just let his concentration slip for a moment.   Also the gameplay looks to me a bit like chess: Opening moves draw certain responses.   And another problem: A lot of the die-rolls are 50/50 rolls that let you either win or loose whole fronts. In no other game that I played was victory so dependent on a certain roll. And this gives a roll IMHO too much of an importance - taking away from overall strategic decisions.  Finally:  It is more a game than a simulation with a not-needed  WW1 theme  - and that is its major fault.     </comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">A decent deck builder but I feel it just wasn't for me. No criticisms or perks just not my cup of tea.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="Finland">Star Realms imitates Dominion but is designed for two players only. However, Star Realms is inferior by almost every aspect. In Dominion you at least get the satisfaction of analyzing the setup, deciding on a strategy, building your deck and seeing your game plan come to life. None of this exists in Star Realms, though. You cannot have a strategy, since you just have to choose from the cards drawn from the deck. All plays are made at the tactical level without a long term plan. Moreover, the round has a tendency to end even before your marvelously built deck has shown its crafty potential. You do not get a chance to show your cunning. All you need is just a small deck of cards that deal a good amount of damage, and the game is over in an eye blink. You do not even want to buy any further cards because it just slows down your fast rotation of cards.   A poor game, trying to take a fresh approach to deck building genre by ditching strategy, most of decision making, and the thrill of building your deck. Honestly, I cannot understand the appeal of this game. If you like tactical level games that end quick and can be played without giving the game much of a thought, Star Realms might be your cup of tea. I just find Dominion more appealing offering something for both, the strategists and casual players.   And it is not even that I despised tactical games, on the contrary, I love many of them. But it is just the fact that after buying a few cards, you just dash for the finish line without doing any more decisions.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Netherlands">Game literally driven by cards. Making a strategy or tactical plans are useless.  I experienced this game as extremely annoying. Almost driven by luck. I have seen too often situations where I or my opponent don't get the cards I or he desperately needed. You need to move and no move cards show up, but have a hand full of fire cards but no targets to fire upon. This kind of situations happen too often to my taste.  Or what about this situation. Your best leader - the one you can't afford to lose - get suddenly stuck in a wire - an event played by the opponent. The only way out is to play an advance card, which you don't have and don't get. Then suddenly out of nowhere a paratrooper is in your back. Again an event played by the opponent. You're stuck while the enemy is firing and there is nothing you can do about it. This is clearly no strategy game, where the cleverest will win!  The designer gives credits to many games, except the game from which it is clearly derived ... (Advanced) Squad Leader.</comment>

Yes, I understand it's supposed to be representing "the chaos" in battle, but there are much better mechanics available in other games. It's a perfect example of the worse card-driven wargames can be, with all the randomness and lack of control.

The major downside though is the downtime between turns whenever there is a battle or battles. They can take a while and usually only the results really effects you. After a few even I was walking away from the table to look at the other games being played. As a 2 player game I think it is very good but not so for me with more and if you are playing with more, do not use the beginner setup as the objectives are very evenly spread and it seems to become basically 2 2player games happening on the same board.</comment>

This might be a 9 but I'm a little burned out on it after only 12 plays just because when we play it it's all we play and we tend to play this rather than other games I want to play, which sucks.  Update: playing the android version (while sometimes boring due to the lack on human element) has taught me a lot about aggressive calling but has diminished my opinion of the game somewhat due to the predictability element.   another update: I continue to grow bored with this game. It's good, but the honeymoon period is over in a big way.  yet another update: After playing some trick taking games (notably 42 and Tarock games) I'm pretty sure I prefer them. I also don't know why a blown call accrues negative points instead of adding to your opponents' score. The way the rules are written the game could theoretically never end.   After continuing to discover and play more trick-takers I don't know why anyone plays climbing games. There's no discovery phase and watching someone go out because nobody can play on a full house is utterly boring. I don't despise Tichu but if I never played it again I wouldn't care.</comment>

I should probably play again, just to shore up my opinion, but I pretty much hated playing it.  I felt like whoever draws the most blue tiles is screwed, and the one time I played it was me.  red tiles are way more valuable than the other colors.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Finland">Knizia's classic abstract strategy game has never been a favourite of mine. The design is brilliant in its elegant simplicity, but despite the simple rules there is a very deep strategy game hiding beneath the ugly surface and the steep and long learning curve. Many people, myself included, just aren't interested enough to suffer through the painful stage of "learning by losing" to care for finding it. casual gamers should avoid this game like the plague.   The balanced scoring is typical for a Knizia design and works well, but the main problems are still "the rich get richer" and the luck of the tile draw that can really screw you over, especially in conjunction with the warfare mechanism.   Aesthetically it's also very poor, but that is trivial. </comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United Kingdom">Playing a few times face-to-face was required before understanding this game. A bit dry and long for my tastes but I can see why it is liked so much.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United Kingdom">Have played a few times now and feel it's too luck driven on what tiles you draw which would be fine if the game was half as long as it is or there was a way to manage being short of one area but the scoring is based on a balance of all colours so being weak in one area cannot be compensated elsewhere, although there are treasures and monuments they are hotly contested.  The obscure nature of what is a "good" action often means that players of different mindsets create odd games where several people think they are taking their best action but its not necessarily true or maybe it is, it's too obscure. Often one or two players get left to their own devices and win or people not paying attention to who needs what colours creates a problem if you don't control someone's weakest area and allow them to run away with the game  The hidden scoring adds to this problem as the colours are taken openly so it's possible to keep track but the game is complex enough that you need to focus on your own strategy quite a lot without enough time to focus on what other players are scoring. It would probably be a better game with open scoring but probably changes the dynamic too much. </comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">This one is headed to the chopping block to be traded or sold. Was not impressed my the game play.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Finland">More is not always better, I could say. In the heart of Trajan is an action selection rondel mechanic, which is a neat solution for everyone who like to plan ahead and phase their actions. So this should be a game for me since I like phasing.   However, in Trajan things have been taken a step or two too far. You're not only setting up for your next couple of actions but almost the whole game. You are not creating combos but piping your actions into certain order. I reckon, this is mainly because the situation on the board via player interaction changes too slowly to keep the planning horizon from stretching 6-7 rounds to the future. Personally, I think this is just too much. Oh, I do adore games that leave room for long term strategies but it is not the same thing as planning all your moves beforehand.  This pre-planning creates a problem: You definitely do not want to mess your carefully planned sequence of actions but sometimes the tactical situation might require something else. Often a single miscalculated step puts you off the track and you will spend several turns to get back on it. In a brutal game like Trajan, this usually equals to giving up the fight for the win. So what happens is that everyone will just concentrate on their own rondel and player interaction will become even less. Solitairish games are usually not a problem but Trajan is all about being first in whatever you do.  There are a lot of good qualities to this game and I can see why it is highly rated. It just did not hit the sweetspot for me who likes pondering the subtler consequences of my actions instead of leaping from one cliff to another with no margin for error. But at least you have meaningful decisions to make throughout the whole game.  One more good thing is how you get points from almost everything you do. Some people criticize Feld games for this, i.e., being VP salads but I quite fancy it. Those single VPs you get from myriad of things do not win you the game. They are just consolidation prizes giving you a feeling that you achieved something. You do not need to perform a ten move sequence to score points but managing nine moves is already rewarding.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Singapore">A never ending game of mankala with columns of differing colors. Worse part of it is playing it solo. No one really cared what each other was doing. Maybe some part of the game we would be concentrating on 'getting there first.'  But as it dragged on, no one bothers, as even if you did, you will just be slowing down the leader to let the others catch up. In which, you will go further down.  Move to A to get B for VP type of game again. Worst, is that never ending cycle to want to go A,but you need to go 2 rounds before you come back to A. Thus the game drops down to moving only 1-2 peg, just to repeat what we need to do. A more frustrated version of worker placement game, except, that you can't really place it. Rodel in a different format. Afraid nothing really genius about it. </comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Poland">This is a "classic" worker placement game with a nice theme and beautiful pieces. There are multiple strategies while the rules are simple and straightforward. The final is epic, you may reach 150 points (out of the max 400+) in the last turn, rewarding players for a long term strategy. While there's no obvious innovation, the game plays flows nicely and the mechanisms are well glue together. EDIT: getting closer and closer to a master strategy, I start to feel that the game is less impressive than I initially thought. Rating might go down after a few more plays if my suspicions are confirmed.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">I really dig into the theme, but the QB issue has finally sucked some of my enjoyment out of the game. The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.</comment>

It took around a week of watching rules videos, reading the actual rules, and looking at posts on BGG to even know how to play. When I finally knew how to play the game fell flat and the flow of play was constantly interrupted by flipping through the rules to find one of the 900 exceptions in a badly laid out rule set. I am however still interested in trying this more in the future.   </comment>

    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="">To me, this just felt like someone took a generic MMORPG and put it on a board. Coming from World of Warcraft (on PC), it's just not a comparison - and I didn't even care for that. It plays too slow, so you don't get a sense of panic or anything, and the decisions aren't very interesting, so there's not much for you to think about while playing, either.  For me, I'd rather play something like Space Hulk: Death Angel, The Lord of the Rings Card Game, Apocalypse Chaos, or TIME Stories. All of these (except TIME Stories) do a better job of evoking a sense of panic, as you play, and provide a real battle mechanism for the fights. Or, in the case of TIME Stories, it has a better system for telling a story, while the game is still just a "roll to see if you succeed" style game.  When playing an MMO, you have to work out a game plan in advance, coordinate in real time, prepare the right supplies, get your timing right, and so on. There's some amount of randomness in a big fight, but it can be completely mitigated by the proper tactics and preparation. Getting that all into place takes skill and effort to accomplish.  Or if you're playing a traditional tabletop RPG, really the hope is that the players will come up with clever ways to defeat the enemy beyond just "I use my sword", "Okay, roll 2 d10...good, you hit him for 2 DP." It's supposed to be centered on storytelling and improvisation. The dice serve purely as a mechanism for the DM to simulate any random idea under the sun that you might have.  All of that is lacking in Descent. It's not interesting from a storytelling nor mechanical sense. There's no game to the game. But all of that said, I suspect that this is largely true of most dungeon crawl board games and, probably, most people aren't looking for more than that. Descent seems to be the most popular title in this area, thanks to how streamlined the gameplay is. So, if you enjoy a game where you're rolling a dice and seeing what happens, then this is supposedly the best of the bunch.  Personally, I'll play those other games.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="England">1-5 plays. I was extremely disappointed with this as I was convinced I would really like it. It oozes theme and I think the Fellowship/Ring to Mordor/Hunt mechanism is excellent. However, at its heart, it's a wargame - and a distinctly average one at that (if anything it reminded me of Axis &amp; Allies but not as slick). The game is overly long with much of the time spent fiddling with the pieces and understanding the plethora of rules nuances and the exceptions created by the cards. Whilst the board and pieces look extremely attractive, in game terms, the implementation is poor; Mountains and regional borders are not particularly clear; units just don't fit in the regions and regularly cover key cities/strongholds which, if you're not totally familiar with the map, can be fatal; the decision to (presumably) cut costs by making allied nations all the same colour makes it virtually impossible to distinguish them resulting in a distinct loss of gameplay and a feeling that you spend more time trying to understand where you are rather than actually playing the game. Now I accept that this is based on one play and familiarity will address some of these issues but I found Squad Leader easier to take in and less clunky after one outing and the prospect of spending another 20 or 30 hours just to get to a level where I can start to think about enjoying it as a game is not my idea of fun. I'd be happy to play again but I would much prefer it if some of the theme had been sacrificed for playability and a shorter playing time. And a final note, to flag this as 2-4 player game is merely to satisfy the marketing people. This is a 2 player game. The rules for 3 &amp; 4 are tagged on at the end in an attempt to sell more copies. </comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">The time alone, 180 minutes, turns me off on this game. I think I would be enjoyable but I think it would collect way too much dust to really be a good game</comment>
    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="Finland">Very similar to Werewolf but I much prefer the latter one. In Resistance the dynamics of the group does not evolve throughout the game since no characters get killed. Once you have worked out who the bad guys are, it's a simple task for the good to win.  I also find kind of lame that the only way the good players get to contribute to the outcome of the game is the voting for the group that goes out for a mission. In werewolf you at least get to execute other players.  I guess that the designers wanted to have a Werewolf without player elimination but at the same time you agree with sacrificing the very best part of the game. Must be that I am a werewolf.</comment>

Worse, it is often surprisingly unintuitive and surprisingly fiddly.  While I'll play it sometimes, the lack of a theme and the "meh"-ness of the game as a whole put it pretty far down the list.</comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Austria">I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  Good thematic wargame, that will appeal a lot to all the fans of the books/tv serie. Being not a fan of "A Game of Thrones" myself, the theme is nothing that excites me particularly, but I see and appreciate the effort, that the designer put to integrate the theme in the mechanisms.  As far as the machanisms are concerned, it's a well designed game, but nothing that I'll go out of my way to play. The first reason for this is the lenght: the game is too long for what it offers me. I like the card combat a lot, but I'm not a fan as much of the orders or even more of the event cards and the supply mechanism. I don't like the way the different kinds of unit work and I also don't like the fact that you're not involved in the game with all the players. You actually interact only with the players that are close to you on the board, while there's very few or nothing you can do about those that are "geographically" far from you... and while this is fine in a game like 7 Wonders, I'm not sure it is in a war game. These things simply do not click for me.  Of many war games A Game of Thrones is not the one I'd like to play if I could choose. I like the components a lot, some ideas are neat, but all together comes out strangely mediocre. I'm sure that this game really shines if you enjoy the theme, but - if you don't - there's many other games you can choose from, that are actually mechanically better.</comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="">This was a strange one. The person who brought it didn't quite know the rules, having only played it once several months before, and then not read the rules when she bought it herself. So it's possible that this colors my perception of the game.  But in play, the game felt like the designers kept hitting balance issues when they were playtesting and, to solve that, instituted a wide variety of bizarre, non-thematic choices. I'd say that it felt like an abstract strategy, due to how divorced the rules were from reality, except those generally have clean, simple rules. This had rules coming out of its ears.  Apparently, it was designed as a variant of Diplomacy. But instead of requiring that multiple people attack, in order to win a battle, the designers chose to make battle more like Sumo wrestling, and you just push people back if you attack them with too few troops. This has the side-effect of giving the person you attacked a free movement, to expand onto more territory (which is exactly not the outcome you would expect of winning a battle - even if it wasn't a complete massacre). And in order to prevent you from bringing a lot of troops, they added a rule which basically prevents you from putting your troops together (you can feed an infinite number of troops, unless you put three of them on the same square, and suddenly that breaks the bank).  The end result is, as it is in Diplomacy, you really need to have allies attack with you if you want to win a fight. But that occurs as a side-effect of a byzantine set of rules, rather than simply being made into a straight-forward requirement. It makes it very non-intuitive to play and hard to teach, and more liable for players to end up playing wrong until they've played the games a few times.  Overall, I didn't love it. I feel like you'd do better to toss the combat rules which come in the box, ignore the feeding the troops rule, and play with regular Diplomacy rules for combat. Maybe the rest of the game is fine. I don't remember anything much more about it.</comment>

This is really annoying and creates an unnecessary steep learning curve.  I also felt that this time Mr. Rosenberg has gone over the top with the number of individual resources. In Le Havre you could still keep track of things but in Ora&amp;Labora it felt just impossible at the first play.  Yes, I will play the game but won't buy it myself at this point. Ora&amp;Labora just doesn't offer enough new ideas after Le Havre/Agricola.   2013/12 With more games setting the standard for a 6, this is clearly a 5.</comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">1st play: I quite enjoyed this.  A refinement of the Legendary system, I like the exploration of the card rows and the sense of danger from flipping over the cards to see what happens.  The coordinate mechanism is cool, and allows for some interactivity.  It's not too difficult a choice, but it's nice to feel like you're able to contribute.  The theme is less awesome for me than Marvel, but the game is better.  2nd play: Quite a bit harder this game, and I ended up dying almost without any ability to react or prevent it.  I don't like when games make you lose without an ability to react.  In this case, I could probably have taken different actions to prevent it, but to do so would have been pretty sub-optimal (waste 3 attack points out of fear of a chestburster), and I took a strike that dumped my hand without any way to prevent or avoid it.  I still like the game, but not as much as the first play.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Mali">Great quality, but the game mechanics, very close to Ascension and the like, are a bit average. while you can't win without a strategy, actually being able to set one up is very luck dependent.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Sweden">My initial reaction was very negative. After playing the full campaign and playing each scenario multiple times I think I have a more clear view. My honest feeling about the game are "Meh". Its okay. There are no real meaningful choices, for a deckbuilder there isn't that many options to thin your deck, the game sometimes feels like it just chuggs along. On the other hand, those totally random moments that make no sense but are just epic are really exciting. That one in a hundred chance when you actually get a good hand and you get to do a lot of things to almost turn the game around, and then even with all your planning you die/lose because of a cheep card reveal wile frustrating is still exciting. I could take it or leave it. </comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">1st play: I liked the game ok.  I really have to play it again to form a full opinion, but the challenge for this game is that it is compared against TTA, and it comes up short.  It's nice to play a 2 hour version of TTA, with a bit less depth and better art.  The big problem though, is that there's not a lot of compelling choices.  One building feels very much the same as each other building.  Some of the cards don't feel very thematically appropriate.  2nd play: The game was better this time. We played without the advanced cards, and we shuffled better.  Unfortunately the game is blah.  It really just feels like a very abstracted worker placement game.  None of the things you do in the game feel important nor thematic.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Finland">+ Shorter playtime compared to TtA (Nations is easier to get to the table). + Better with more players, while TtA is playable due to down time only with 3 players. + War system worked actually pretty well (even though before the first game I was a bit worried) - Somehow the building of your civilisation did not feel as palpable as in TtA. I guess it has something to do with the ups and downs each civilisation must face are much stronger in TtA. - Mixing the stability feature to the wars was confusing and it seemed overpowered - In the end you get points from everything, so the scores are close and it's hard to tell why someone actually won.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Germany">Where do I add the "overrated" tag? Feels boring, doesnt have any new or interesting concepts. Through the ages was fun when it was new, but this? Nahh...</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Poland">After one play only, but I don't see myself playing this game in the nearby future. Foremost because it's too long. It took us 2,5 hours (3 players only) to reach end of renaissance (we played everything basic as the rulebook suggested), then we decided not to continue. Not because we didn't enjoy the game, but we just had to depart. Anyway, I don't think it's a bad game, but definitely not for me now - too long, too much bookkeeping (I truly didn't like that aspect of calculating everything end the end of each round, didn't seem elegant to me) and - as a result - not as much fun as I expected.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Norway">Simple, fast-playing, but very abstract game with some strange rules (heavy units can be killed just as easily as light ones, attempting to cross a river actually makes you safer when attacked, etc.) The more varied units in this game compared to Memoir 44 makes it a little bit more tactically interesting. But not by much. I know little of how battles from this period was fought, but I suspect this game does a bad job at simulating them.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">A little "heavier" than Battle Cry, but still a very good game.  I find myself becoming more interested in this period because of the game.  Lowered the rating from 7 to 5.  Scenarios are almost always unbalanced to the historical winner. I found that after playing some of the Worthington Games offerings which use a die for activation, the cards plus the right-center-left battlefield limits the types of battles that can be portrayed. </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Singapore">The only wargame that my son of 7 years understand. It's simple but I need to tell him how many dice to roll.  Good introductory wargame that is worthy of a good spot in my collection.   However, I felt it was not very good for old Wargamers like me. This game has no historical feel or logic in battle. In that sense, it's just a meh game.</comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">A really cool game that suffers from some pretty debilitating flaws.  Love the mechanics and implementation.  Works very well.  Why the not-love?  Some of the goals are awful as common goals.  Streakiness of buildings (how many of each are included) is horrendous.  And there's no easy fix because it's a core game mechanic.  If you get lucky and invest in x tile when all of the parts for its engine are in the game, good for you!  Otherwise you lose.  Oh well!  The lack of being able to predict what your engine should be is wrong.  Also, a couple tiles are too powerful, or can be too powerful in the wrong hands (i.e., my opponents').  I want to like this one (really!), but there's too much not-quite-right with it and my enjoyment is hindered.  Ah well!</comment>

En una segunda partida he visto que tiene un un problema del que no fuimos capaces de salir.  El problema es que un jugador muy agresivo, con un ataque decidido, hace que todo sea vigilar las v&#237;as de suministro y como cort&#225;rselas a los adversarios. No hay incentivos a jugar las cartas como eventos, como reemplazos o como otra cosa que no sea mover para rodear y desabastecer a la mayor cantidad de fichas contrarias. Las ventajas que provoca eliminar unidades desabastecidas (en vez de combatir contra ellas) es indudable, lo que te obliga a embarcarte en este baile mortal hasta que uno de los dos cae.  Eso s&#237;. Es entretenido, pero no es un juego que simula la I Guerra Mundial.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United Kingdom">ASL with 95% of the reason and accountability sucked out. Definitely not related to Up Front. Overall its slow [slower than ASL], cumbersome and not very intelligent. Tried a dork tactic as it seemed likely to work: I wheeled an HMG in the open road and had a duel with an LMG at the other end of the street and amazingly I won!! then we put the big gun back indoors. Smoke seems totally impenetrable, close combat totally deadly, but fire attacks not very. About the only impressive feature was fires breaking out occasionally in buildings, as this is accurate and also something ASL does poorly.  Antidote: anyone reading this really, really needs to play ASL. Having 100% of the story is a thousand times better.  PS: tanks will never work on this planet.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">I can see the influence of various games on this, such as [thing=10630][/thing], [thing=1035][/thing], and [thing=24321]Panzer Grenadier[/thing].  It's a simple wargame -- heavier than Memoir, about as heavy as [thing=22825][/thing], without the pieces.  The cards make an interesting mechanic, yet at the same time, create odd situations where an enemy moves right up to you, and you cannot fire (more so than you see in Memoir), and the timer mechanism makes you want to burn up cards, creating gamey situations.  I understand it models "chaos" more than "tactics," which isn't my cup of tea, but may work more for others.  Overall, not bad -- not as good as the BGG-hype, and it's not as good as the games I listed above, but it's fun.  I would recommend it for the light wargamer ready to take the next step up from Memoir.</comment>

I think it's a soundly designed game, but I think it might kill Ameritrashy FFG games for me.   I played with blue which seems really underpowered, and because of a fluky event card deck, placing corruption was very, very difficult for 90% of the game. On the other hand, red seems to be very overpowered, and eventually won by leveling up. I didn't feel like I was in control, or in competition, for almost the entire game. My choices were limited, and didn't provide me much benefit that I could see. I don't find the theme or artwork very appealing either.   The components are nice, but I can't really think of much during my four hours of playing that was anything but frustrating and unpleasant. I had initially said I would try it again some day, but after sleeping on it that is doubtful. We'll see.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United Kingdom">Assymettrical, fantasy area control game, I don't know why I ever played it to be honest, not my cup of hot chocolate at all.

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Singapore">A reasonable strategy game with some fighting. The different types of power reflect the 4 factions well. Theme wise is cool.   But if you look beyond that miniature, you might feel the game is unbalanced and very dependent on card draw. A player could be easily eliminated within the first few turns.   May seem right if that happens, but for a euro-themed game, than that's not too good.   Other than that, it's just an area-card-battle game that does not titillate me much. (don't get me wrong, I love WH40K. I have 15 armies!) but this game just did not make it for me. It just felt like a weak war-ish game. Did not satify me when we finish the game.   ---------- After a few years, we dig this out for another run. It's still not what I would have liked. The game play is still pretty good but.......it's a straight average game indeed.</comment>

The stations are a nice touch if you get hosed on that long route or caught out near the end and use that last turn to try and complete something. In particular, the addition of the tunnels and ferries gives the game an edge of the US standard.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United States">We have played this dozens and dozens of times, especially on the iOS app, but my gaming tastes have moved on in recent years.

The advanced version sounds like it would be fine too.  I don't like the breed of "clever" which is defined by staring at a board long enough to know which decision is perfect, so it's hard for me to like this just like it's hard with AoS.  I think I'd like to give it a shot with a 3P-only map to see how much that might reduce AP.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Finland">Goa has a poor interesting decisions vs. play time ratio. Auctions are the meat of the game and the phase of greatest interaction, but they only constitute 15% of the play time. Most of the time is spent on solitary paralysis when you are trying to make the best use of the actions no one can block or influence. This part of the also grows linearly with increasing player numbers.  I have to say that Goa was an ok experience but it is not a game I would suggest.it just is too long for what it i, which is a shame since I usually like auctions. </comment>

    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United Kingdom">Seems like it should be a game i'd really enjoy but the imbalance of the card track strategy renders it useless. I may try playing with less VP's for cards to see if that helps.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">I had heard a lot about this game. It plays pretty quick, the auctions are fun, and the game feels like a mix of Puerto Rico, Endeavor, and an auction game. I think this is probably also one of those games that improves as you play it more.   Most Euros I feel like there's less to them with repeat plays, but I think this one would be better the second time. These ratings though, are reflective of first impressions. In that sense, the game was ok, but nothing unique out of the gate.</comment>

I have since downloaded a bunch of game and player aids to help us in case we do get a game in (and I can already tell they'll help big time). Since Goa is so highly rated as a 2-player game, I want to play again before I rate it.  UPDATE 1: Finally got a chance to play Goa with 4 players, and it took all of us nearly forever to figure out the rules based on the rule book. However, well worth the effort! For me, Goa is in the same category of games as Puerto Rico, Caylus, and Power Grid - except Goa is way better! I will elaborate another time! UPDATE 2: Lowered my rating due to painful headaches that appear when I think about the rule book - 2 hours to go over the rules and find answers to basic questions! </comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United Kingdom">We played with four players, and two placement positions. I suspect five players and three positions or 3&amp;2 would make a different and much better game. The limited placement meant that little happened, and that slowly, making this an extreme case of a design that prevents players from playing. Viticulture is three- and five-player only, I think, and the makers should have warned us.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Italy">Too much randomly.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Wales">Very average worker placement game. Very mechanistic and little fun. Not convinced the theme is a good choice for a light weight Euro ie family game. In no one way meets its grand claims. Stick to Agricola and Stone Age they are much better. Only the components are better than average. </comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">A bit dry, too long, too dependent on luck (overpowered cards, even in the 2nd edition).  Would be better if it would play in half the time.  Village and Russian Railroads are much stronger worker placement games.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">A worker placement game with not enough places to go around.  This would be a tight game of tempo and being out-of-phase, but on top of this are added decks of cards that are both extremely powerful and not at all balanced.  Drawing the right cards at the right time seems much more important than careful planning.  This needed to spend much more time in development to get the details (approximately) correct, as the result is too light to be a heavy economic game and much too heavy to be a family game.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">I wanted to rate after 2 plays, and the designer has asked for ratings, this score could go up if I get the chance to play with Kickstarter exclusive content and expansions - but those were not available in the retail copy I played...  The game is a very solid first published design, with outstanding production values.  The theme is well integrated and the game is fun, BUT there are balance problems.  The cards are very swingy and it really seems that the game could benefit from an early/late game deck split for the visitors.  Also, scaling is an issue - the 2 and 4 player games are terribly tight and very slow starting.  Turn order toward the end of the game is extremely important, too much so in my opinion.  There are just too many better worker placement games out there, despite the excellent theme and presentation.</comment>

Maybe it helps if you are into Warhammer 40k?.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Germany">Pros: Great asymmetrical abilities. Quick predictable battle system. Unit abilites have a huge impact on the game. All units are useful. Great victory condition.  Cons: Extreme runaway leader problem. Player elimination and often early. Turn order determines your strategy and often decides the winner of a battle. Imbalanced starting positions. Obvious upgrade paths. Battles usually go the predetermined way and take too long for that. The loser of a battle is greatly punished.  This started at 9/10 but fell quickly.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Sweden">The clever action selection with order tokens and gorgeous components can't make up for the combat resolution which slows things to a grinding halt. It reeks of typical FFG in-house design: overwrought and needlessly complicated. At the core is a decent wargame that, if the combat rules were streamlined, could play in an hour or so--but the usual FFG treatment has turned it into a bloated mess.</comment>

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">I do not care for this highly rated game.  The economics are too tight, the bidding mechanism is brutal for newer players, it is very easy to fall into a debt spiral from which there is no escape.  And to top it off, I found the game to be exceedingly dull.  I spent all that time auctioning, laying track, upgrading the train, and going deeper into debt just to pick up a cube and move it for a couple points?  What are we playing next?</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United Kingdom">In a way, this is a "gamer's game" par-excellence.  It's deep, edgy and precise.  You needn't bother asking Aunt Maude to play this one after tea, in fact even amongst your gaming friends only the most serious would enjoy it.  I may change my rating as I play it now, but as I see it at present, the plusses here are: great depth, agonising decisions, cut-throat play, replayability, room for lots of different strategic thinking, subtlety.  On the negative side: get behind early and you struggle/get ahead and you're hard to stop (in some games of this, it can be a total killer), badly written (though simple) rules, dull art work, a fairly high degree of luck for such a strategic game, some players may think there's no fun involved in it (you won't get smiles just a lot of head scratching).  And it's pretty dry and very mathematical.  The last third is rinse and repeat after setting youreself up - just ship as many goods as you can for the maximum you can make.  That might be something that burns your brain in the planning, but in terms of the spin off at the end, it's pretty dull in terms of fun.  For myself, I sort of enjoyed it the first time, but felt less good about each time I played it thereafter.  I wouldn't say that it was enjoyable as Wallace's other highly acclaimed heavy game - SoE, though it's about as deep.  But that depth is in very different ways, and whilst this is good, it's not one I then long to play again, which I do with SoE.  Having recently played Railroad Tycoon, I marginally prefer that...but I'm not big on that one either.  RT is not as pure, but it's slightly more fuhn.  Actually, I'd say the game where about 80% the same, which makes RT more "AoS midi" than "AoS lite."</comment>
    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="United Kingdom">This is based on 1 play.  We found the game pretty dry and to do well you have to almost plan the whole game from turn 1.  Maybe we didn't get it.  Will update score after more plays.  Definately better than we first thought, but still pretty dry.  On reflection (a long time later) I just don't think this is fun.  Downgraded to a 5.  And game traded away.</comment>
    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="United Kingdom">Hmm...there's a a lot going on here and lots to think about.  You can pursue lots of different strategies and come from behind.  I liked those things.  On the other hand, it's a trifle dry, the theme isn't very strong and there's very little inter-action between the players.    It's this last quality that worries me the most.  Games like that just don't seem to provide the crucial spark.  I know a lot of folks think that this is the bees knees and I can, perhaps, understand why they would rate it very highly, but I just don't see that it could ever be a top 10 game...but it is rated that here.    "Fun-wise" it's kind of average...no wait a minute, it's actually a bit below average for that.  Yes, it can be fun to solve a puzzle like this, but not as much as pitting your wits against someone who's competing for the same space as well as the same resources.  Nor are you going to get gasps of surprise, shock or laughter playing this.  Having said that, I can see why it would be popular amongst those who are hard-core heavy-euro players.  And they are the biggest grouping here, which explains the rank of this game. I'm not in that group of people because I like a bit of everything (not just heavy Euros), and in any case with heavier games I like to feel that I am involved in something mentally AND socially stimulating and this  fulfills only the former criteria.    Having said all of that, I guess if you are the sort who likes to maximise scores in an analytical way and it doesn't bother you whether playing a game paints almost as much of a solo mindscape as doing a Sidoku puzzle, then you would probably favour this over something like Wallenstein or E and T (2 other games in the top 10).  So, I'd say, this is good and worth playing again, but is not amongst the top ones I'd reach for.  </comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">A Lord of the Rings themed cooperative game?  Awesome!  Well, except I'm not so sure the cooperative part of it really works out so well.  Most of the scenarios have fairly clear strategies that must be utilized for the heroes to win, so it isn't really a game of "assemble whatever deck you'd like and go off on an adventure."  Generally decks have to be assembled with the specific goal of completing a specific scenario, which means that the game is cooperative only so far as you discuss with your companions what the correct strategy is for whatever scenario you've chosen to play.  Once everyone is playing by the dictated strategy to complete the particular scenario, it doesn't really feel like every player (or any player) is adding continual input to make the game feel cooperative.    Works okay as a solitaire, though.  Nice art in the game, also.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United Kingdom">I suppose it was inevitable that the evolutionary path of efficiency games would lead to ever more complex puzzles.  La Granja follows that path by throwing together a sackful of elements (Glory to Rome's multi-use cards, dice drafting, resource conversion, buildings and roofs that offer special powers and several ways to score vps).  It certainly does feel more an assemblage of mechanics and less about building up a farm than did Agricola.  Nonetheless, credit to the designers that this Frankenstein's monster actually works and - once over a significant learning curve - is really quite playable.  However, for me it still has the cold, clockwork heart of an efficiency game.  The artwork is pleasant enough.  I felt that the main board should have been a little larger.  Too much is crammed into it to potentially confusing effect.  Some of the icons are also a strain for these ageing eyes.</comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="">A totaly hyped game. Does not have anything original, all mechanics are from other games and the dice roll action selection is already seen since Yspahan, and copied from a lot of Feld games. Now you see it again and think its a great game. So tired from this dice mechanics. Please bring something original.  The best of this game is the use of the cards in different ways, but because of that you can make a real unbalanced combos.</comment>

    <comment game="Jaipur" game_id="54043" location="United States">A simple and fast commodity trading game, I think it works best in terms of it's size and requirements to learn, and ultimately you're not only trying to exploit the cards that show up as a set collection aspect, but also knowing that your opponent is working on similar sets. The camel piece is a nice touch and helps move the center market along. I do think having the most camels at the end is under valued though, but not by much. Maybe that's intentional, I don't know.  Ultimately though, it's not the quick game I'm most inclined to reach for, but it is fun when it does hit the table. I think the best of three rounds for scoring can drag, but it almost takes that long to get a feel for how the game is going to progress...</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">My favorite of the TTR series. Small/cramped, and sort of unforgiving. It also plays fairly quickly (and well) with just 2p. Best when folks don't spend a lot of time deciding on their moves as it's such a tight game that you can see the end written on the wall in the late game phase.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United Kingdom">Quite a high rating, maybe because it works as a three-player if not so well as a game. Its not quite so Baldrickianly brainless as TtR, nor as crap as the Europe game, nor as successful designwise as Marklin. Whoever gets the best cards and tickets win will, though its not impossible that one game in five could be determined by player input.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">Two things stand out; it's an engine builder and it's (somewhat) asymmetrical in it's strategy. The later (in particular) salvages the game IMHO as it prevents players from just cracking the engine formulas and running the game into the ground. Still possible, but less likely. Driven by cards, each side will ultimately build a slightly different engine that is tailored to their faction's strength and to counter the other faction. In particular, that what the opponents faction is helps (in some way) determine what you should do to counter them; "do they produce lots of gold by require workers? Time to raze their worker production and hamper them." That sort of stuff help gives the game some staying power as each faction will have a weakness and counter that you will need to work on. The cards really save it as it's not a rote execution of each factions strategy; the initial lookout draft and what cards comes up also keeps the game fresh. The solo game is no slouch, and if you're into that sort of thing works really well, but the game shines at 2p. Above that, and I find it drags and it's tough to keep track of what everyone else is doing (although, that's only necessary when razing as there is only so much one can do to stop people outside of that).  I think the three dings I have against it are that it's basically an engine builder (which I find aren't particularly interesting or interactive). It solves the later by asymmetry and ability to break sections of their engine which is nice. Second, while it's interactive in the draft (passively) and razing (actively), that's about it. I get the appeal, it's just not something that turns me on. Last, passing sort of blows (although the exploration tile promos *do* help solve that problem). Still, an ok game and I do enjoy my plays (even the solo mode was interesting and deserving of praise), but it only gets so many plays before it just gets old, for instance, Lewis &amp; Clark has a much more interesting and opaque decision tree, which holds it together, but L&amp;C less interactive which is a trade off.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United Kingdom">Was surprisingly disappointed with this one. Very solitaire. Buildings aren't very interesting; produce resources, or spend x to get y, or turn x into VP. Later turns are just a sprawling tree of resource juggling actions that gave me tunnel vision. Good solo game, because other players are basically redundant!</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">1 play / 4 players  LIKE: Lots of powers and combos to explore. Fun to plan out your production cycle. Cards graphics are well done. DISLIKE: Small text on cards, bleh! High conflict (eye-for-an-eye attacks) is a big minus, especially for the Japanese faction. Some downtime for the players who passed in the round.  OVERALL: Felt a little bit like Nations, but I enjoy the player interaction in Nations better. In Imperial Settlers, I felt the razing to be too confrontational, "eye for an eye", which I cannot stand. Without that conflict, it is too hard to slow down leaders, making some combo engines ominously powerful. Not bad, but I'd rather play something else. Maybe a couple more plays would help. </comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United States">*Rating based on one play.  This was a game on my "gaming bucket list" that I wanted to play once based on its reputation.  I found the game decent enough, but it's not one that grabbed me.  This game seems to be considered a heavy Euro, and I'd say that is true based more on the wide decision space the game provides than on the complexity of the rules, which is more of a mid-weight in my opinion.  It was certainly my experience in my one play with two other newbies to the game that you need to play this game several times to really know what you are doing in it.  We all made some bad tactical blunders in the game that, with more experience, we may have known to avoid.  That said, I don't know that I enjoyed it enough to give it that kind of attention.  Pros/Cons +Mechanically solid game without too many rules exceptions.  It has definitely aged well over the last two decades. +Has some interesting mechanics, like the different colors of victory points and needing to balance them to win. +Highly skill-based.  The better, more experienced player should win this game most of the time.  =Very cutthroat and confrontational.  -Very thin on theme.  It is a Knizia game after all. -The combat mechanism of using tiles from hand feels quite random for a strategy game of this type. -Overstays its welcome.  We finished our game in about 2 hours, which felt too long.  Overall, this is a game that I recognize as being a quality design, but one that just doesn't hold much interest for me.  I'm glad I played it once, but don't know that I'll ever feel the desire to play it again.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Trajan isn't a great game. At least, that's my first impression. I do like it well enough - and I want to play it more. But my take away is the Mancala mechanism is surprisingly complicated for little result. It turns out there's only one purpose for the colors and that's to get the bonus Trajan tiles (appropriately the name of the game). Yes, those are great and they add a different angle on the game. But it seems overly complex to have that result of what is nearly just a free turn. So there's a frustration to this central mechanic that overshadows the fun for me. Then around this mechanic are what many now call victory point salad. That's alright for me - it keeps you thinking and always puts out a reward. But over all, Trajan just isn't blowing me away. I am glad that is plays at all given that I'm color-blind!</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">I'm down on the scoring/points salad aspect, but the mancala action selection has a lot of promise.  I've yet to play with a larger group, which could add more tension.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="">I am beginning to see a pattern here with Feld games:  lots of quirky and interesting mechanics very capably put together, with lots of different paths to victory to explore on multiple plays, and...virtually no real theme, or sense of thematic play, very little direct player interaction, and very rudimentary, ho-hum spatial elements and challenges.    Trajan may very well be the pinnacle of this Feld style, but for me, curiously, after really admiring Macao and Castles for this Feld style, with Trajan, it feels like it is beginning to wear thin and appear inadequate from a game design perspective.  Where is the player interaction in this game?  Where is an actual theme?  Is it asking too much to play a game where you feel like you are thematically doing something other than trying to cleverly produce victory points using clever mechanics?  (For what it's worth, I think Feld's Luna fares better on theme, player interaction, and interesting spatial aspects.)   And as much as I admire Feld's use of a circular mancala mechanic here in Trajan, for me, it really continually underscored that this is a game, devoid of theme, where 75% of your playing time is spent trying to manage your game of solitaire, going around in circles all game.  In truth, I guess I don't care for games where the dynamo, the driver of the game, is a process of going around in circles (eg rondelles).  Why am I staring at a small "solitaire defined" circle for 2 hours?    So Trajan is definitely a challenging and interesting game.  Fun for dedicated gamers for sure.  But ultimately, Trajan was so thin thematically, it felt to me like much ado about nothing, absolutely nothing.  Giving it a 7.  April 2012.  No desire to play this again, so giving it a 6.  October 2014.    </comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Finland">2014-08-11 Russian Railroads is a relatively simple worker placement and an euro at its purest. What I especially liked was that you score several hundred points in a game, which makes those little differences count. However, the fact that you score more than half of the points in the final scoring (after the 6th round) feels a bit stupid. In the end, the first five rounds matter very little, since basically you are just building your position for the last round point rush.  And building that position is not too difficult.    What I would have liked to see is possibility for great plays in the early game as well.   Update 2015-04-14 7- &gt; 6 Rating dropped after a few more plays. The game has started to feel rather one dimensional. You select a strategy and push it with 100%. There is no changing plans in the mid-game even if you see that your chosen strategy is heavily contested. </comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">Above average worker-placement game with lots of paths to victory, as long as you don't diversify too much.

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">1st Play: Really hard to judge this game. There's an engine building aspect to it that I very much missed in my first play through. It did seem like a good early round would lead a little bit to a runaway leader problem. I knew I was out of it by round 3. I'm not typically a fan of that in games.  2nd Play: This game turned out to be a prime example of why a game needs to be played twice before I rate it. It's still not amazing, but I had a decent time playing it. The action choices made more sense, the way the tracks work seemed to flow better, and I understood what was going on more completely.</comment>

Played it with 3 players once and we had a fun time.  The master builder mechanic makes this game unique.  I may prefer Suburbia over this, but more plays of both games are needed.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">I enjoy this more than Suburbia for the more relaxed feel,  more attractive theme, and the price setting auction which requires me to keep some attention paid to what others are doing (this is really where CoMKL adds interaction between players compared to Suburbia). The initial setup really blows though, makes me want to play 2 or 3 games in a row as a result, and like Caverna, I highly recommend either making an insert or buying a custom one. Second, the same number of turns regardless of player count looks nice on paper, but causes the game to stumble as you remove the tiles at random (In some ways, I'm curious how it works if you do a 2p game with 3p tile counts, sure, it takes longer, but how does that fit). Still more attractive in terms of desire to play than Suburbia for us.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">2 plays / 4 players  LIKE: Building castles. Being the master builder and selecting how the different rooms are priced. DISLIKE: Iconography overload, and some icons are hard to discern. Game felt too long. OVERALL: First game, we were all learning so perhaps that is why the game felt long, but some players were calculating min/max point scoring with certain combos which slows down any game.

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United Kingdom">A game that strips out all the things I disliked about Suburbia, while retaining some similarities, both superficial and mechanical.  Ludwig's market, with the start player setting the prices of the available rooms, is perhaps its nicest feature.  The rest is about placing rooms with harmonious neighbours and chasing bonuses.  It all works perfectly well and I'd be reasonably happy to play again if it were suggested.  Given the beauty of the real Ludwig's castles, the game's artwork has to rate a missed opportunity.  There is a lot of drab grey and much of the art has a cheap, computer generated look.  Production quality is decent.     </comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United Kingdom">First play with 4p on starter/beginner mode, too easy.  Second play with 2p on Normal, despite some bad luck we clutched it out on the last possible turn (no cards left in deck). Should have been an exciting climax but fianc&#233;e was already bored at that point. Not enough depth for her and too much disconnect between the theme and the mechanics, particularly when finding cures. "Where is the science?!" she cried. Looked into the 'In the Lab' expansion but I doubt that'd change her mind.  Solid gateway co-op, but don't think it's for us - better that we pick a gateway that everyone can enjoy. </comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Lots of theme here, love it. The game is overall enjoyable, the epidemic cards really added a lot of tension to the game. However, once it was done I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied... "that's it?". It is difficult however when teaching new people to not basically play the game for them (do this, do that). It seems as long as one person has a strong understanding of the game they can simply instruct the other players and come out winning, which doesn't say much for the "cooperative" aspect of the game... I would play it again, but I traded it away as it didn't see much play from my shelf.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United Kingdom">SOLD! Definitely a clever concept (which intensifies over time much like a virus outbreak would) though it turned out less fun than I had anticipated. It kind of felt like an exercise in logistics - I have also briefly played with the expansion which does add some more flavour though overall the game is  light fun. The cubes should have been given hideous disease names such as Ebola, Avian Bird Flu, accelerated H.I.V. and Bubonic Encephalitis (is that real?).</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Very challenging, tense, but enjoyable cooperative game.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="Malta">I am not a big fan of co-ops, but this is a relatively good game. Most of the time, you can feel the tension and the feeling of helplessness, which is a thematic plus. Production quality is fine and the game has solid mechanics. I found the game easier with 2 players than with 4, so I recommend playing with more players as some of the tension is lost.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="Canada">Co-op.  This is an okay game, with the right group it's a fun little puzzle to solve together.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Like most co-op games, this usually turns into a game of "group think," which I don't enjoy.  Otherwise, an enjoyable casual game.</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="Finland">Shallow theme. Requires too much calculation to play efficiently, which slows down the game. A campaign of several sessions can be a fun experience.</comment>

Update: I can't bring myself to rate this one above a 6.  We haven't actually finished our first campaign, but several times we seemed to be presented with [i]highly[/i] one-sided scenarios, which isn't very much fun.  Update: We never ended up going back to this one, and I don't imagine we ever will.  It was a great idea, but the lopsided scenarios killed it for us.</comment>

We camped a lot to heal up blocking the dragon with stun and then we killed the dragon and the archer and the boss ran out of the dungeon.  Fail :D  Took 1 hour before the game actually started with all the talk and the healing wasn't all that fun either. Would be more fun if people moved more quickly. I'll play again but what I think long-term depends on how swiftly it plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United Kingdom">nice twist on things. and is definitely a big hitter these days. however this game is much more of a skirmish game based in a dungeon than a crawler. some of the features are great. but i feel there are way too many components. most certainly an improvement on the first edition streamlining the rules where possible.  oh and the minis are pretty awful too. we enjoy a game of this from time to time. but it is nowhere near a favourite at the gaming table</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United Kingdom">Wanted to like it. Felt incredibly linear to me. HOwever this is only after one play. I need to play a few more times I feel.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="Malta">Intricate mechanics weigh down the game. Luck dominates strategy. As getting the right cards at the right time and rolling the actions you need for the turn or actually getting the hits you need for success, can all get in the way of careful planning.  A strong  theme and the sense of doom, can be felt while playing. Components and artwork are of a high quality (although the text is a bit small on the cards). Really shines as a 2-player game.</comment>

I've only played the FP side twice and felt like I just didn't have anything to do except wait for the SP to attack.  Kinda boring for me.  Got lucky and moved the Fellowship fast in the early game, and unlucky in the end when drawing Shelob's Lair and eyes which really hurt.</comment>

    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="United States">A bluffing game that is very fun and interactive to play. Win or lose the fun is playing the game. I find I like the game with 5-6 players and start liking it less the more people are involved.  I have played with 10 players where I have not gone on a mission or been able to choose a mission basically making it useless for me to even be there. </comment>
    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="United States">10+ plays, 6 players  LIKE: it's the "role" game I like the best. Players have more options on their turn to think about. Merlin is fun. DISLIKE: acting is needed.  OVERALL: I hate werewolf. This isn't as bad as werewolf, because having a task and being on teams makes the game less confrontational.</comment>
    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="United States">Not much to catch me with this. The Resistance was a fine alternate to Werewolf, but these social lying games aren't really a style of game I enjoy. The implementation of this one doesn't distinguish itself from others at all - being only a retheme with slight variations.</comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="">Brainburner: the Game.  Too many things are happening each turn. I'm sure this game has longevity and replayability, but the bar to get into it is set very high.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">Very unforgiving game the first few times out.  The first 2 games I played I never broke 16 points.  Random bonus cards make it very hard to plan out a viable strategy sometimes.  This is a very heavy game.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">I *really* want to like this one, but the different paths are illusory.  There's an optimal path in the available options and if you don't take it you're in trouble and way behind those who do.  That's just not good enough.  Still, it's a fun game and I like it.  I really want to find some house rules that fix these things.  There's a great core to it, just needs some balancing/touch up.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="Spain">Traded Not a bad game. I got it and I thought that we will like it. After one game and having the game sitting in my shelves for long I decided to trade it. However, I would like to play it again with more people.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">This has long been on my "Want to try list", and I finally got to play it. I've been looking for a good euro-style game that involved dice. This was great. I felt like I pulled off some great combos, I was able to build a money engine out of the cards available, and the elements of the game just fit together well.  I would never play this with somone who was AP prone, as the decision tree for each move is huge, but for my game group, it's an excellent game. It's going on my breakup list I think. </comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="United States">Update after 2 Plays: I think I'm done with this game.  Dropped from an 8 to a 6.  This game is just too long.  First game was 6P, quit at 3 hours after round 7.  Second game was 6P, quit at 4 hours after round 6.  It's also fun for the first several rounds as you build up, form alliances, and make your first attacks.  Then it just starts to feel like your taking and re-taking the same areas, trading back and forth, over and over.  No sense of progress.  And the ending feels completely arbitrary.  Someone would happen to win at the end of any round but if you go another round or another, it would probably always shift.  Not planning to play this again.  Possibly should rate this a 4 but I might give it one more go, perhaps with less players.</comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Romania">This is an area control game based on the Game of Thrones universe. Don't be fooled, this game is not an adventure game, so do not expect to give back the story from the books or TV-series. Basically you will start with one of six noble houses of Westeros, then through careful planning will assign actions to your armies on map. Then after the planning is done, in turn everyone has the chance to execute one action having in mind that one must control seven cities or strongholds to instantly win the game, else it ends after ten rounds. The downside of the game is the long downtime of the planning phase, and it doesn't really work well with fewer then six players. The game can take easily six hours to play out, but if you are a fan of intrigue and warfare it is a perfect game. </comment>
    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="United States">I'll start by saying, I don't like the IP at all. The actual storyline frustrates me. However, this game did a good job of putting the player into the struggle, jockeying for position on the throne, fighting military battles, and using covert networks for information.  The game is well made, and a good game for 6 players. The length is long (which I knew going into the game) and there's a bit of a kingmaker aspect to it, but all in all, the game is well made, with good bits and I'm happy to play it a couple times a year.</comment>
    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Norway">Fine strategic wargame based on the game of thrones universe.   A little too slow to be a really good game, and the it has some balancing issues. Some houses have a much better chance of winning than others, and if there is a player who doesnt know what he is doing the player(s) around him get an huge advantage over the others.   My gamegroup where divided on this one, some really like it, others hated all the waiting, I thought it was okay. </comment>

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">I doubt this one will stay in my collection. I think Le Harve is the best for me in this space of games. Ora has alot of fiddly parts to it somehow. And the cards just sprawl all over - making it incredibly difficult to see what your opponents are doing. I think if one loves Agricola and Le Harve and wants more of the same, then this is a winner. For me, I'll just stick with the other two.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United Kingdom">unplayed - have heard good reviews but a lot of comparisons to Le Havre (which I think is broken because there is really only one viable strategy amongst the dozen or so options) and Merkator (which was nice enough but seemed too long with not really much to think about because the available contracts could change so easily),  hopefully this doesn't suffer the same fate. </comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Le Havre + Agricola on steroids.  I love those two so why don't I love this?  It's just too long!  Takes far too long to play out with anything more than 2.  And that really annoys me.  I want to love this game (really, I do!), but it's got to be playable at 3-4 (without being onerous) and not just 2.  So sad.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Sweden">Its pretty much like Agricola. The resource wheel is good, the components are good but the actual gameplay feels quite the same. It's a very good game but the unique features of this game is not better compared to Agricola's so I'd rather play that most of the time.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Amazing design, but a bit too much for me. I'd never sell it as it's such a unique design statement, but I can't say I find the play experience fun or engaging.  Min/maxing this game makes my head spin. </comment>

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United Kingdom">I do want to play this more in theory, but not sure yet how often I will return to it. I like the jigsaw puzzle element of placing the Settlements. As in Le Havre in early plays, there's so much one can do it's hard to choose. HOWEVER-- the components are not good at all, e.g. the flimsy reference sheets, the tiny cards, the wheel that's hard to pull apart, and the tiles that were hard to punch! And the end condition in the 2p game seems odd. I also think it is quite long for what it is. Despite the many good aspects to the design, I somehow never find myself wanting to play it.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="Wales">Pretty dull worker-placement fare, with limited thematic integration. The pictures are all very nice, but ultimately you are swapping resources for un-named cards without really telling any form of story: there is no progression. This is where Agricola excels over superficial games like this one (and others in the genre). The dice-rolling makes the game frustrating at times and adds little. The game works and is not unenjoyable, but it's a tired genre and this is not the most exciting example.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United Kingdom">Its a good game, possibly better for the younger player. Considerable width but little depth, and the usual wood/clay/stone/gold feel of having done it all before so very many times.</comment>

You solve the puzzle how to optimize your hero actions, you kill a bunch of bad guys &amp; get a bunch of loot.  The game is a bit fiddly since there is no "bad guy" turn, but once you get the hang of it all, the game runs pretty smooth.  Definitely fun for what it is, and I do expect to play the heck out of it.  </comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Belgium">Mombasa has some nice mechanics but overall it just takes too long. A lot of complexity and uncertainty with not that much fun...</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">A few cute mechanisms drive an action-drafting-ish "stock" game. The stock portion isn't very interesting - all you are doing is committing further to a particular neutral color being valuable by the end of the game. The cute mechanisms are cute, but don't provide many interesting decisions, just typical Euro efficiency and synergy bonuses. The simultaneous action selection also adds a chaos factor that was annoying.  The cute mechanisms make this a 6 - but when the novelty wears off, I'm pretty sure this will be a 4.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Good game, but fiddly rules.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Not bad, very well designed, but punishing with little opportunity to catch up.  Which is fine.  But you have to have too many things lined up and ready to fire at the same time, and when they don't you kinda blow up your turn (and the next one... and the game).  Should be big among the Euro crowd, definitely a game I will never be good at though.</comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="England">An excellent attempt at a 'hybrid' game that builds up quickly and gets into the meat of it straight from the off and the power tiles are really interesting but the heavy reliance on turn order (i.e. going last) is just a little too important for my liking</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United Kingdom">First play fell a little flat, would like to give this another try. Good dudes-on-a-map game where fighting is strongly encouraged and nowhere is safe. An all-you-can-eat buffet of tech options which currently feels a bit overwhelming; I expect further plays will help but it can leave new players a little lost</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United Kingdom">It's ok.  Perfectly playable and quite fun.  Definitely large on chrome and not massively high on strategy, but it passes along reasonably quickly and has a fair degree of tension.  There seems to be a craze for games with lots of cards in them - where you upgrade or by pwers having first built something to improve them - this has lots of that.  At first it can be difficult to get a grip on that, and certainly some power combinations seem very powerful - but you soon learn.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">This game would be significantly better if the instruction book was a bit more detailed, and the book that tells you what each power card does wasn't in 10 different languages with no index.  It's not a bad game, but the potential for AP, plus the time it takes to figure out what power card does what really drags the gameplay down.  This game needs a second edition with significant refinements.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Switzerland">This game is a too much of everything. Too much time to play , to much thinking, too much rules, ... and so on.  The funny thing is that you still have a good time because there is a lot of fun in using the app to discover receipe. I was very happy to test it once but won't probably try it again because it's juste tooooo much</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">1st play: Brain-burning deduction game that played very slowly on the first run through. Needs to be played again soon so that I can figure out if it's a keeper, because it needs to be a little shorter, and I'm not sure if the artifacts will vary the game up enough between plays to make it replay-able. Really high barrier of entry makes me reluctant to teach it to new players.  2nd play: I really enjoyed the second play through, even more than the first. Teaching it was easier this time and we were able to explore the game more. The actions flow together well and the theme blends with the mechanics smoothly.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">I really admire many things about this game: the depth of the deduction challenge, the excellent art, the elaborate cardboard components, and the evident dedication to implementing a very strong and creative game design concept which, in this case, includes interfacing with an App.    However, playing the actual game was simply not that much fun, and for me on my first time game, felt more like a chore than entertaining.  Sure, I want to solve a puzzle tonight as much as the next person, but do I yearn to solve a singular puzzle sitting on my cellphone screen, or would I rather have fun playing board games tonight?  It is my sense that this game is going to fall flat with many gamers who play it for the first time.  Some, like myself, will have problems with key component readability in low light, trying to discern the difference between a plus and a minus sign within a small blue circle, etc.  Some will want to really solve everything on their turn, and run through all the permutations, and thus be gripped by times-a-wasting  AP, which will anger the other waiting players.    Others will mistakenly place a "result circle" in the wrong place on their deduction grid and thereafter completely screw up their theories, feel like they wasted three hours due to a mere clerical error. And some first timers will simply give up trying to figure out how the combination cancellations and neutral results occur using colors, circle sizes, and plus and minus signs. Who really cares about abstract colors, circle sizes, and signs combining?!  I do?  Not really.  I do like the betting on other people's theories aspect of the game, the student experiment mechanic, and the discount bidding spot.    I feel like I should want to play this obviously very interesting design again, but for better or worse, I actually do not want to play it again, so gonna have to give it a 6.</comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Canada">This game lacks depth. It's a light jaunt. If you want a hardcore co-op with atmosphere and decisions, get ghost stories. If, however, you want to relax with friends over a few beers while reminiscing about the alien movies then this might be the game for you.  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1323402/negative-first-impression</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Pretty decent for a cooperative game with player elimination (not my favorite mechanics).  It feels brutal and hopeless the whole time, and it seems like you really need to know the decks to do well.  Still, it was a good ride to ruin.  The theme is terrific and well-integrated.  Glad to hear they addressed all 4 movies!</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Only played solo -- waltzed through movies 1-3, Resurrection ate me for breakfast repeatedly.  Don't play it solo unless you severely modify the difficulty, or want to fail.    One of the best marriages of theme and mechanism in board games.  I just wish the character decks were *slightly* more balanced -- it's very easy when customizing the game to have very little or even none of a certain type of action, i.e. healing wounds or scrapping junk cards from your deck. I'll need to play with others to see how much that matters.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">First play with a team of 5, 2 of us new to the game, got utterly destroyed by the game. Nice, but not my favorite type of game.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United Kingdom">Love this game.  My friend has it and we've had a few plays.  Very hard to actually win, but still entertaining.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Too gorey for Anastasia and I. We have too many other excellent deck-builders to justify keeping this on our shelf. Bonus points, however, since it was given to me in pristine condition and fully-sleeved FOR FREE from a dude in Stow.  Now I've traded it away for Queen's Architect in a math trade before the latter game has been released in North America. Pretty sweet.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">The first scenario for "Alien" is quite difficult, at least as a 3 player game.  This is especially true during the first objective.  Unfortunately, this difficulty seems to come from the randomness of the initial draws rather than any real strategic or tactical errors.  It feels like the game is relying too much on theme and atmosphere and lacks worthwhile decision making.  I've now tried both Legendary and Legendary Encounters and neither has been a keeper for me.  </comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Thematically wonderful! One of the few games of this "fight the aliens" genre that really gives a feel of the desperation of the endeavor. It helps that I like three of the four movies (especially Aliens), but the theme does extend to the personalities of the characters as played out through card abilities. Lots of variety in decks/replayability.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="">Fun deck builder with difficulty and pacing perfect for the theme. Coordination mechanic helps make this a Co-op game. Traitor mechanic seemed difficult to pull off covertly from the limited number of plays I've had. Events,Hazards and scenarios executed better and in a more interesting way than in Space Hulk: Death Angel.  Would go out and buy a copy myself if it were re-released with built in sorting or if it went Digital.</comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United Kingdom">This is meant to be a "Through the Ages" Lite but it fails to deliver. It seems to have a large amount of randomness which prevents any form of long term strategy being formed so it's just a case of minmaxing turns. It also isn't that much shorter than TtA so it doesn't have a lot going for it over TtA.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">A solid game, but it makes me wish I was playing TtA. I do like the decrease in downtime, but not the lack of card refreshes between turns.</comment>

Meanwhile, I have played TTA online a ton and haven't really tired of it.  If Nations were available online, I wouldn't be particularly interested.  So it goes.</comment>

    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">This is a nice game. Some luck with the cards and dice roll are indispensable like in all the games of this kind. Very little strategy required compared to other wargames. I'm not even sure this is entirely a wargame, but it play nicely, it's entertaining, and it conveys a nice atmosphere. </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Canada">A very light introduction to wargaming...and fun to boot. Gobs of luck, but you can't depend on luck alone.   My complaints are mainly about the presentation: why blocks? There's no fog of war, so what's the point? And the iconography on the stickers is soooo tiny. Cardboard counters should have been the way to go. A greater variety of cards would've been nice, too.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Netherlands">Yahtzee with colored dice. Well, I don't dislike playing this game, but I don't consider this as a wargame, but rather a strategy game. But it's a bit of fun too, in spite of the widespread combat results. The (un)lucky die rolls can be frustrating.  The rules, card deck, blocks, leaders and scenarios are too generic. You'll never get a Marathon, Zama, Cynocyphalae, etc. feeling. Well at least I didn't. There are no unit facing, scenario specific cards and I have to look on the unit sheet frequently, because I can't memorize, while the needed information could have been on the blocks. In its' essence the game is not much different from Battle Cry, Memoir '44 and Battlelore, though it has some improvements.  Two other points of critism is that although units take hits they don't decrease in strength until eliminated and that battles suddenly ends - when the required number of units have been eliminated. There is no anti-climax. Just a sudden end, which always feels dissatisfying to me.</comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">1-2-15: I download the iOS app and played it a few times. The scoring mechanic was a complete mystery to me until we actually sat down and played through the cardboard version, which we obtained at a math trade swap last year. HUGE difference!  Update 10-12-15: This is one of our 10x10 games this year, so I've had a chance to play it a lot. Sadly, this is one of the few games I can remember where the more I played it, the less I liked it. This game is too fiddly, the theme feels pasted on, and worst of all, it's very, very boring for me to play it. Buy a tile and place it here to go up on this track, but I go down on this track. Yawnnnn... I find myself preferring Castles of Mad King Ludwig over this game more and more.</comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="Wales">After the ingenuity of the marketplaces in Glen More and Peloponnes (two very similar tile-laying games), Suburbia feels simplistic, derivative and a little bland. The theme is fairly well integrated, but a city-building game seems to me to require development over time of each individual tile (either enhancement, decay, or production abilities). The graphic design is poor and adds to making the game a very dry experience. However, with all that said, this sub-category of the tile-laying genre (whereby tiles are directly affected by those placed adjacent to them) tends to produce an enjoyable experience regardless, and Suburbia is no exception. It's simple to learn, with pretty deep strategies involved. Incorporating the fashionable-right-now variable winning conditions (Kingdom Builder) and secret objectives (Troyes, Archipelago) seems a little forced, but I guess it will prevent one over-riding strategy from winning every game. If this is your first foray into the genre, it's a fine game. If you've already played Glen More or Peloponnes, you don't really need to consider Suburbia.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">It turned out to be all I suspected it would be: great theming, but very mathy and thinky in the way you resolve tiles. There are several angles to check - too many that can cause missing a payout. I do like the idea of gaining income and reputation to impact your progression, but the game is also unforgiving if you get in a revenue pit. You will fall behind in despair. All this adds up to me not enjoying the experience much, but would like to play a bit more if in the right mod.</comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="Austria">I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  I didn't dislike Suburbia, but I also didn't enjoy it as much as other people seem to do. There're some aspects of the game that bother me and made the experience not so fun. First is the real estate market mechanism. It happens a lot that I couldn't get what I needed just because of the way the tiles came out, because, when the turn came back to me, that tile was gone. Often also the second choice was gone and that left me with some suboptimal choice that I was forced to take. That is just too random for me and simply isn't fun. Even more than that is the end game situation. While I appreciate the unpredictable end game trigger, at the end of the game I feel like I didn't get where I wanted to go with my strategy. I'm just entering that area of enjoyment for what I built and achieved, that the game finishes. That deprives me of the sense of accomplishment that other games about building give me. Another minor complaint is the chaos that often comes from the tile activation. It happens easily to forget to apply some effect and that's annoying. Although this probability disappears with experience.  Overall Suburbia is an ok game, that failed to meet my expectations. For sure I understand why people like it so much, but some of its design choices just don't work for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">I may have initially rated this higher than I should have. The game was.. meh.   The main problem I had with it is that the tiles that are randomly removed can significantly change what strategy will work, but there's nothing you can do to plan for what's coming. The result is the blind choice you made on turn 5 determines whether you win or lose.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="">I want to like it, but there is a lot of luck here.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="Canada">I suppose the mechanics do tie in with the theme; but it doesn't prevent Suburbia from being a fairly dry, non-immersive game. The utter dreariness of the drab art doesn't help at all, either.  A remarkably fiddly game, and the tiny icons just add to the fiddlyfest. While Suburbia is not a luck-driven game, luck-of-the-draw DOES play a huge part with regards to the individual goals that a player can strive for: many of the goal targets cancel each other out, and players can be in a boring Mexican stand-off with one another.  I see clearly why there are speed-bumps in the VP track, since there is a most definite runaway leader problem in Suburbia...even with the speed bumps!  A very good redeeming quality about Suburbia, though, is how utterly different each game will be.    </comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Fun tile laying game with set collection/synergy scoring.  The city planning theme works well with the tile laying/board building aspect.  The scoring is reasonable for a game of this type, and the challenge of managing the reputation/population levels is fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Pros - Cool tile laying and city building aspect - Fun interactions with different tiles - Encourages forward thinking - Thematically, where you place the tiles makes sense  Cons - WAY too much bookkeeping. Easy to miss something small since there's a lot of symbols on the tiles - Thematically, I don't see how scooting tiles over after each turn fits. The longer they're out, the cheaper they will become?  - "Goals" in the game are very tricky and nonsensical. </comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">Looks like a long game that would probably only be played a handful of time in a lifetime. I would like to play just to feel the largeness that this game seems to offer</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United Kingdom">Card play trade offs are very gamey - do I take reinforcements or attack and so keep the card in the deck, or play the event on a particular card and so remove the card from the deck? Interesting trade-off, but gives the player too much control over the timing of events such minor powers entering the war and faces the player with choices very different from those that faced their historical counterparts.   Ultimately a CDG with in this case a WW1 theme, albeit an intricate one, painted on. So a better game than a simulation, but impressive nonetheless. </comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Italy">Ok, it's fun and full of tense, but many things about ITALIA are wrong: MAP: there isn't connection between Milano-Bologna-Ravenna while this was one of the most important road since roman times. Asiago should be mountain space (many alpine battles where fought there). Venezia should be "swamp" since many rivers cross the plain around there. Maggiore should be a "corps only" space. UNITS: are underrated at least for the defence CONDITIONS: Italian army had many deficiences in heavy weapons when entered war, but was immediately able to launch many and bloody offensives and this along all the war, so units should start at full state and replacement points should be more. POLITICS: NO foreign armies (of both alliances) should enter Italia for political reasons. OVERALL CONSIDERATION: Italia proved herself a RESOURCE not a DEBT for the Allies; was a situation quite different from WWII: Italian engines were sold Worldwide, Italian troops were sent in France and Balkans... VICTORY: real italian weakness was political and emotional, so Italia would be out of war if Milano or Bologna were conquered by Austrians. Playing with the standard rules means Italia out of the game in a couple of turns if you have a clever/expert CP player; the strategic situation on other fronts is irrelevant: nothing can save italian units from destruction immediately after war declaration and is impossible to recreate them with a replacement rate so low. Thumb down for Italian front.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">[I]tl;dr Star Realms is a great deckbuilder with a peripheral sci-fi theme but great interactions. The authority track is an especially great addition to the game.[/I]  I was introduced to Star Realms after my father-in-law picked up Colony Wars at GenCon and wanted to introduce me to it. He's logged hundreds of plays against AI opponents, so I knew I would get blown away, but it presented another chance to learn a deck-builder, so I took that chance.   In Star Realms, you are trying to buy ships and bases to activate powerful actions that will let you, well, buy more ships and bases. Like most deckbuilders, there's a lot of repetitiveness in Star Realms that can get old. However, I did appreciate the game's main point: siphoning the opponent's influence down to 0. This makes the game feel incredibly personal and strategy choices have far-reaching effects.   Timing is everything. I was able to beat Tim down to only 4 points at one time, but his superior cards and VP-generating capabilities let him quickly recharge and proceed to steamroll me. If I had collected myself a little better, I could have made that one big push more efficiently. This optimization part of the game definitely appeals to me, since I'm prone to be excessively tactical and optimize individual turns, without a longer-term strategy. Star Realms forces you to do otherwise.   Since playing with more players, I can say that the strategy shifts with four players as you're trying to beat other players down but eventually just finish one or more of them off. We found that we'd generate ridiculous game-ending combos off of each other and shut each other down. So, like most deckbuilders, this ends abruptly.

    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">Seemingly deep game that ends up playing itself.  Not a very good game, despite all the hype.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="Netherlands">Fun 2p game, but not too much more than that.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">Too random. There's not enough ability to plan your strategy. It usually boils down to whoever gets the most Outpost Bases first, and comes down luck in terms of what comes out of the deck.  I wish there was more control over what happens in the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="Canada">I haven't played many card engine building games so I cannot compare them to each other.  The positives for me: science fiction theme, fast play, highly competitive, attack cards, cool combo cards.  The negatives for me: the scoring cards are a PITA (although you can come up with your own scoring system I suppose). Variability relies on expansions (= $). Fells like I am playing the same game over and over again by which I mean it feels like a re-themed Dominion. That's a not a bad thing and I am probably a little off with the comparison but the feeling remains.  I'd play an app or computer version but don't think I'd play the card version all that often.  So 7 for the app version and 5 for the card version leaves me a 6.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="Netherlands">Play this on iOS. It's a neat game, but I personally prefer Ascension.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">Fun little deck-builder. mechanics are much like Legendary, but as a two-player head-to-head version. Have not yet played multiplayer version as you need to buy more base decks. The expansions add some variety, but it's largely dependent on luck of the draw in cards coming out.</comment>

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">RRT is certainly no Age of Steam, but it is a very enjoyable game for what it is. I'm really curious to try the Rails of Europe expansion, I think that will really cinch this as a good game to have around. UPDATE: I think I'm done with the basic map. I still want to try Europe... we'll see if it can convince me to keep the game around.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">1 play / 5 players  like: big game arc. interesting catchup mechanism (payout goes down after a certain score). dislike: personally not into railroad themes too much. huge emphasis on turn order.  overall: although the theme is a slight detractor for me, the game is easy enough to play, but first time players will be dwarfed by the more experienced. need to play again, rating is tentative.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Finland">This is Age of Steam for casual players. The best thing about Railroad Tycoon when compared to AoS, is that you don't have to calculate all your spendings beforehand. If you happen to need money, you just take a new loan.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United Kingdom">Hmm...well, I'm no big AoS fan, so you have to take that into account here.  This has 80% of what AoS has.  So, it is not really "AoS-lite" - more AoS midi.  The faults that AoS has, for me, are mainly repeated here.  This comes down to the facts that it doesn't score well for me as either a brain burner or a as fun game.  As a  brain-burner it gets too repetitive and mathematical; in fun terms, it gets kind of dull at the end - rinse and repeat...just ship a load of stuff for as much as you can.  Ok, so the other train game that's mega popular here (TtR) does the same (keep drawing cards), but somehow that game is more fun to play than this...probably because until the end you always have something you can do, like draw new routes or end the game early, or score 15 pointers. Granted TtR is about 40% as deep as this (depends on the version), but it's about 500% more fun.  Here, the last third kind of plays itself - you've made your bed (track is laid) and you just endlessly ship stuff to make it (your point score) as cosy as you can.  Yet, I feel that this is marginally better than AoS.  I don't like the huge board (I'd shave 20% off of it) which makes me feel that I need to stand and move around to get perspective, or the silly, badly designed scoring track and I don't think that the cards add that much other than a bit of extra confusion.  On the other hand, the share system is better here and I also slightly prefer the handling of the turns and since the bidding doesn't seem to matter much I think that helps the game balance a little (even if the bidding can be dull as a result).  Overall, I think "the joys" of the AoS-type system have mainly escaped me.  I remain distinctly uninspired by either.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United Kingdom">An okay game but I feel it's dominated too much by the cards. I've heard this is improved in the expansions but not really tried them.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Denmark">Ok game where the theme fits well. Sometimes it can be a bit dull.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United Kingdom">Seems to be the most accessible pick up and deliever train game, it feels balanced until you get to the secret objectives, the game should probably be played without them. Plus have a fully auctioned turn order rather than just the first player each round.  Does seem better with Rails of Europe. I haven't played enough to really be sure.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Germany">I really like the game but somehow it doesn't end up on the table anymore after I got introduced in the 18xx series. While a few errors can condemn you to finish last, it is quite often easy to spot what to do next. So it is a lot easier to play and a great way to get people introduced into more complex train games.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Canada">Played Railroad Tycoon several times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 2-5 times). Tracked on family list (grooven)! Update: Dropped rating on this one as I'd rather play a ton of other games first.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Italy">Rating based on three plays: each time one of us made the first three objective (first delivery, first delivery across three cities, first to get the fourth level locomotive) and went on winning with a huge advantage (more than 15 points above the second place).Clearly we're still learning how to play, but it looks like catching on a runaway leader is more or less impossible. Still a good and fun game. After three more plays I can confirm that catching the leader is impossible (unless you get very lucky with cards).</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Canada">This is a very good game. Unfortunately, it lacks tension.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Couldn't get through it. Rules are a nightmare for beginners. </comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Poland">2010-04-14 (rating 6):  An OK game. However way too random for me. And also not very much in themes I like. I can play it if someone really wants to but on my own it is doubtful that I will like to play it.  The card driven mechanic is interesting however for me one has to small influence on the cards he/she has.  The units and weapons seem to be were realistic.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">I've revised my thoughts on this game quite a bit and my rating has dropped 3 points as a result.   Pretty good system. The random elements are nice and spice things up a bit provided they don't get too out of hand. However, it does seem that combat could be a little more effective than it is. And it would be nice if all the card cycling could be reduced a bit which does get boring. However, it is an nice design that I'd generally be willing to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Good basic concept, but there should be provisions for removing radio-related cards in games where one or both sides lack radios.  Otherwise the players are paralyzed about 25-30% of the time.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Only played once, to learn the system. I like CDG games but am not sure how much I like the mechanic here, as the cards are just a "clever" way to substitute for dice, and it seems hard to plan for how lucky or unlucky any given action will be.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United Kingdom">I'm not a great fan of tactical level wargames, though Combat Commander nearly made a convert of me.  Despite the 24-page rules booklet, it is actually a very accessible game. There is also a strong narrative feel, mostly generated by the fate cards.   That said, the level of randomness in Combat Commander bothers me.  I understand the point of it being there; to snap us out of the perfect knowledge and planning of earlier generations of tactical games.  Yet random events, secret objectives, uncertain game length and the luck of the card draw take the game too far towards the opposite extreme for my taste.  Added to that, those unpredictable events are sometimes simply odd.   Production quality and artwork are pretty much standard GMT.  However, the counters are rather thin. On one game's evidence the rules seem uncommonly complete.  </comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Scotland">Just couldn't get into this game. Not sure why all the fuss. For trade but 1 map missing</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Greece">Initial impressions: Good tactical wargame. Not so complex as it first seems. Amazing rulebook, one of the best I have ever read.  The gameplay is a bit chaotic with unpredictable events happening all the time. Some people might not like this. I say just sit back and enjoy the ride! The components could be better though...   Update: The card driven nature of this game starts to hit on my nerves. I find it pathetic that I have to pass for 2 or even 3 turns because I dont have a Move or a Fire card. I lowered my rating and traded this game. Conflict of Heroes is way better.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Denmark">Probably a good game if you like squad level combat - I have found out I don't.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Finland">A little bit too fiddly and slow for my tastes, but a decent game anyway. I would like to play more to evaluate better.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United Kingdom">I like complexity. I love Dominant Species, which feels like chaos theory in action: many different variables combining into something expansive and beautiful. But the various mechanisms of DS are highly thematic. The Gallerist has similar complexity, but the mechanisms seem for the most part arbitrary and unthematic. With a few exceptions (investment in works of art, which are represented by very nice tiles) neither the components nor the mechanisms evoke anything about the world of art and art galleries. Renaming the game "The Gallerist's Accountant" might give a better sense of what the game is really aiming for, but I'm afraid even that makes it seem more exciting than it really is.  If you ignore the theme and just consider the skeleton of the game play, there are many better "point salad" games.</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Sweden">Beautifully produced game, little bit uncesessary complex for what it is, the mechanics could need some streamlining. The better game of Co2 and kanban. The game lacks development, you basically to the same things in round one as in the last rounds in the game so it gets little-bit repetitive. The game is better on fewer players since there is less kaos.  Half of the game is good, i wish the designer delivered 100%. The games main mechanic of getting bonus action from anticipating what other players will do drags down the game rather than enhance the gameplay. That mechanic creates percieved downtime. In a 4 player game, you could practically miss a turn if all other players get bonus actions and you dont get any. For me its just bad design.   </comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Only played it once, but I'm not sure what I think of it at this point. I was annoyed when the peasants "sued for peace" and I (Khorne) actually listened! Very cool theme, though.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">I really do appreciate the asymmetrical sides in the game and it has some interesting takes on area control. But the theme is very off-putting to me. It's too gross really - the game board, the player representations, the concept of the game. Not for me. </comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United Kingdom">Very much reliant on everyone playing their faction properly. One weak player can swing the game considerably. Not sure I'm keen on the randomness of the Old World cards and tokens but does mean each game is different.</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Brazil">I enjoyed this game, all the different aspects of the different races and the way you play the cards, summoning and everything, the only thing I didn't like at all was the fact that not all units are worth playing, some races don't never play their gods 'cause it is not worth it.</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Suffers from a few optimal plays in early turn figure placement and optimal upgrade cards.   The dice honestly seem like they really don't fit this game at all. Everything else is so exacting and then you throw a very random wrench in the gears. The buckets of dice system is awfully random. Combined with Khorne's dial being one kill per territory you can easily get one dial advancement counter one turn and five the next with the exact same setup. Or you can get six kills in one territory on two dice (yes, I've had this happen several times). It's just wacky.   In a theoretical second edition I'd like combat to be a different system. I'd love this game to be diceless but it would require a separate combat deck or something with major reworkings.   update: I think I've come to terms with the dice but I'm still not fond of the exploding on 6s thing as it can get kind of swingy. I like the threat of more kills than the number of dice because it keeps the planning from getting too finely tuned, but I would like it better  if it were limited in some way.   probably final update, as I haven't played in years: Chaos seemed brilliant when I was first starting to get into boardgaming as a serious hobby. It showed me the light. I still love the theme but my opinion has dropped from great to merely good and my enthusiasm for play has diminished accordingly. If someone wanted to play Chaos I would do so, though I would rather not play Khorne since so many of his decisions are rote. As it stands I would not request a play except perhaps in a rare fit of nostalgia. I have too many games with the same amount of interaction but with less rough edges and balance issues. Plus, I have a friend with a small stack of COIN games which fill an identical niche.</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="Italy">Really good gateway game, it never missed the target so far. Simple rules, some strategic and tactical play and a good amount of luck, decent playing time (maybe a bit too long). The problem is that I bring this game to the table only with non gamers, due to its lack of variability, really interesting decisions and, in the end, any real depth. It's rummy with a board and some positional play. Still better than the original TtR, which is even lighter.  DoW version. Great components.</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="Canada">Essentially an expansion map for Ticket to Ride shamelessly produced and priced as a whole board game.  Having another map for the original game is always nice but this one also adds two new features which are a step backwards, and that is the tunnels which are a push your luck aspect which makes a light game even lighter and more random, and the stations are almost pointless. Incredible that a lesser design (Europe vs original USA map) won a gaming award.   Own the [boardgame=53383]Europa 1912[/boardgame] expansion.</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United States">Don't like it quite as much as the US version.  I'm not a big fan of the tunnels; they add some uncertainty and randomness without adding any coolness.</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="Finland">2009/05 The stations are a good addon to the basic game but I'm not sure about the tunnels and ferries. Worst of the TTR series.  2014/10 Original = Best for families with 4-5 players, elegant rules, suffers from card hoarding strategy  M&#228;rklin = Most satisfactory for gamers, strong incentive to make early plays mitigating the hoarding problem, a bit fiddly  Nordic = Best for families with 2-3 players, slight hoarding problems which are mitigated by the tight map, random take that aspects due to the tunnel mechanics  Europe = worst of the bunch in all aspects</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United States">This game, while very good, is no Age of Steam (which I rate a 10).  The reason: the lack of goods production chart.  Without any randomness regarding when goods will come out, you don't need to be as flexible, and without the look-ahead provided by the chart the game is significantly less strategic.  What I mean by this is that the game loses almost all of the pre-game planning found in Age of Steam, where you look at the board and the goods display to try to come up with a plan: where are my 2-deliveries, my 3's, etc.  All the way up to trying to find the cubes you (hope to) be delivering at the end of the game.  Of course, you can't assume the other players won't interfere: it's usually best to have several different plans in mind at this state.  In Steam the altered production mechanic makes it much easier to have the cubes you need when you need them, so this planning is greatly reduced.  Unfortunately, this planning is the strongest part of the game.  I'm not trying to get into the war over which of these is superior and whether John Bohrer or Martin Wallace bakes better cookies.  I feel that the best part of Age of Steam has been developed away in this game.  The remaining game is good, even very good, but it is not excellent.  It is, however, much more accessible for this reason.</comment>

    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">Fantastic game. Fairly deep yet simplistic in design and execution. However, it can be very mentally taxing since every move you make must be optimized to play efficiently.   Dropped to a 6 from an 8. Dislike how everybody starts out unique (different advantages in separate skills), but becomes more similar over time. Comparative advantage is still maintained at game's end, but not by much (player distinctions become lessened through advancement, which is the opposite of what I'd normally like).   Nice game otherwise. Perhaps a bit abstract. </comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Finland">Viticulture offer nothing exceptional or fresh. It is just a basic worker placement for its core mechanics. The fun factor might be a bit below average. This is due to the repetitive nature of your actions, i.e., harvest-make wine-deliver-harvest-make wine-deliver-harvest-make wine-deliver and so on.   I also did not like how half of the action spaces were useless for the first half of the game and then in the second half you used nothing but them. Personally, I would have liked to see a more balanced use of actions through the whole game. Furthermore, the fact that your first delivery might be the most valuable one and the last the least valuable definitely does not add to the dramatic arc. One reason behind all this is that there is basically only one basic route for victory.  There is nothing broken nor exceptionally bad design choices. Viticulture just feels too much of work, one dimensional, and is at least 60minutes too long to be anything but average.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">*Rating based on one play with some parts of the expansion.  Standard Euro worker placement game that doesn't do anything particularly new.  The division of the round into seasons is one of the unique aspects of the game, but I didn't particularly care for it.  For one, it could lead to extra down time if you pass early in a season.  Additionally, if multiple players save too many workers for the last season, a lot of workers can go unused (or used for a highly inefficient action).  This was particularly an issue for the last turn of the game because most of the point-scoring spaces are in the last season.  The theme also didn't do anything for me, but that's mostly personal taste.  I strongly recommend the expansion if you do try the game.  I haven't played the base game alone, but it looks like it would be very dull on its own, and the player who brought the game said he wouldn't play just the base game again now that he had the expansion.  My rating here is based on using at least some parts of the expansion (particularly the new board).</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">Looks like an interestingly themed and tight resource collection / turn it into some other resource type game but then the wild swing of the cards come into play and the marriage of the two doesn't quite gel for me. The variability of the cards is the game and I don't believe there's enough there to keep my interest after a few plays. I'll probably try to play a few more times to confirm.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">August - :d10-6: :coal: For a kickstarter, this game was pretty good. The theme was interesting, the bits were excellent, and I liked the engine building aspects of the game.  Like almost every kickstarter, it ended up feeling unpolished. There were parts with needless complexity (all the different buildings that no one built until the end), randomness in the form of the cards (there was such a huge difference between how good individual cards were) and pacing issues (by the end of the game, half the boards was useless).  If I were to play it again it would have to be with an odd number of players, due to how strangely tight the game is. I had fun with my one play because the theme and bits were very good. </comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Poland">Classic worker placement with a significant random element which makes the game less fun IMO. Played w/o expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="">A nicely thematic, pleasant and attractive worker placement game that reminds me somewhat of playing Agricola...except without the stress of feeding!  I like the turn order selection mechanic with rewards (look, free stuff!), as well as the planting and harvesting of grapes.  It has an interesting race to the finish aspect, nice interesting components, and plays around with mixing different colored grapes which felt fun towards the end.    On first play, I felt some concerns regarding the seasonal cards, as quite possibly it seemed, among seasoned players, the game might be won or lost depending upon using as many of these seasonal cards as possible.  This is sometimes said about the game Goa as well: gotta acquire and play those special action cards!  Hmmmm...how about playing within the basic design?   February 2015  8 of 10.  On second play, I again found the cards to be seemingly a bit too decisive for my euro gaming tastes.  Draw lots of cards, get good cards that happen to advantageously correspond to the game state, play these cards, and you are greatly favored.  Draw lots of cards, get merely decent cards that happen to NOT correspond to the game state,  play these cards, and you are less favored.  Draw a normal amount of cards that are merely decent, play these cards, and you are very unlikely to win against the preceding two.  Moral of the story in this game design?  Draw and play lots of special cards and hope for a good, lucky draw.  Hmmmm, that doesn't seem ideal for a euro.  September 2016:  6 of 10.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">In my first play, this was the tightest worker placement game I had played in a long time. Where going last basically set met a turn or two behind everyone else because I was locked out of all the good spots. In my second play, with the 'Grande' rules, it was among the loosest worker placement games with really no way of stopping people from doing what they wanted. Plus, in my second game, the winner was determined by who got the best random draw of cards ... and for a game this long, that was unacceptable.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Thailand">Good game and very nice design to fit the game theme. One of that typical worker placement game.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Italy">Viticulture is a medium-weight worker placement game about wine-making. The mechanics are quite straightforward and non particularly original: place pawn, execute action. Rinse and repeat until somebody reaches the goal line.  So, what makes the game good (even if not great)?  First, there is a good amount of tension, provided by the scarcity of worker spots (and it scales very well with the variable number of spots). Therefore, turn order (managed by a wake-up time, &#224; la Fresco) is very important, and the number of suboptimal moves is quite high. The Grande pieces, included in the second rules set, work well in letting players breathe a little.  Second, the theme for once is well represented and everything makes sense, more or less.  Then, why is Viticulture not great?  It is definitely a good game, in the same class of Stone Age or Waterdeep, but something is not as polished as it could be: - the cards feel definitely unbalanced, and luck of the draw makes a great deal of difference; - the wake up table seem quite pointless: going early is better, and the bonuses for going later in turn order rarely compensate this (with 6 players it is pretty crowded too); - players seem to always compete for the same things at the same moment, different "trajectories" don't pertain to this game.  I would like to try it again, but it is hardly the most innovative game, and definitely not one of the best in its genre.</comment>

    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="England">I first played Cosmic Encounter sometime in the 80&#8217;s. My recollection is that it was ok but not really my type of game &#8211; a bit light, too chaotic and random. Twenty years later, having now played the FF version my conclusion is that the game is a bit light, too chaotic and random. However, the variety in the alien powers do make it interesting and worth the occasional spin</comment>

Obviously the players in the game make a big difference...but it was fun to know that even though one of the players stole half the deck (due to the filtch powers - and well played =)  there were multiple opportunities to win in the next few rounds.  The only reason he shared victory with another player is because the other player wanted to move on...</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="">This game gets pretty highly rated in places and I really want to play it more often. So far though, it hasn't proved that popular with most people I've played it with. I think a lot depends on what people are expecting the game to be and how willing to engage in diplomacy they are. This is in no way a balanced strategy game, which seems to be what most people expect.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="Netherlands">Interesting more or less abstract space game. It involves some negotiation and bluffing but this drove me away as there are mechanics I do not particularly enjoy. Otherwise a well designed game, pretty varied (a lot of races + their features), and a nice experience if you enjoy its mechanics. </comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="Denmark">Quite fun to play. I especially like the diplomatic mechanic where you have to agree who to assist in each conflict. The cons for me are however that the endgame can be destroyed by the possibility of several players agreeing on sharing a victory between them.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">Played once on the beginner level. Just enough decision making/negotiating and interaction to keep my attention. I can see how the more advanced cards add to the game. I would be willing to play again.</comment>

    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">It's all about negotiation.  And that means you'll conspire against your friends and/or they'll conspire against you and that's how the game is won/lost.  And that pisses me off.  The utter lack of control, as is inherent to this alliance-driven game, is not my thing.  Which means this one isn't for me.  Still, a fantastic game for what it does and if it is your thing, you'd be a fool to pass this one up.</comment>

    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United Kingdom">A fantastic creation with top quality components.  I appreciate the skill of the designer to craft something so spectacular and with such a broad scope, but for me there's too much in the game.  With four of us it took 4 hours to play 7 rounds, plus an hour for setup and going through the rules.  Not the 120 mins it says on the box then.  The worker placement spaces are so numerous and the choices of direction you can take so varied, we hardly ever got in each other's way.  There was almost no player interaction for the whole game.  We simply pursued different strategies, in the main initially guided by our first occupation.  I mostly went whaling, another player focused on taking items from the Special Board, the third mostly went hunting/snaring while the fourth concentrated on emigration: building and flipping ships to score big points each time.  No-one explored islands.  Three of us ended the game with incomes of 18 and fully covered player boards, feeling therefore we'd done reasonably well - but the winner had an income of 2 with a partially covered board and a final score virtually twice that of any of the rest of us.  His initial occupation was one which gave a discount on emigration.  So he pretty much ignored putting anything onto the main part of his board and just repeated the cycle of paying 2 wood to build a knarr/longship and then paying 3/6 coins to emigrate and turn it into 18/21 points.  So the three of us at the end of the game could say "Yay, I filled my board and it scored 18 points!".   Meanwhile the emigrator lost around 25 points from it but scored nearly 120 from the six emigrated ships - each of which had helped him in-game by reducing the distraction of having to provide for the feast in every round.  The tetris element of fitting differently colored shapes onto your board was mostly tiresome for me.  It was error prone while you tried out 3 or 4 pieces in different arrangements (and what-ifs for whether you'd promote this one or that one to blue) - after a while you think did I try out 3 or was it 4 pieces?  Should I be taking back 3 or 4 to consider other arrangements?  Oops.  A great game, but not one I'd particularly want to play again and I'm glad it wasn't me who parted with &#163;80 for it.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">Mage Wars delivers exactly what you'd expect: two mages going toe to toe with plenty of asymmetrical spell casting goodness covering every type imaginable from enchantments, conjuration, slinging fire and lightning, traps, wands,  teleporting - the works. It is rigidly designed so nearly everything is formalized into phases - something very necessary in this type of game to minimize arguments over rules and effects - and it makes for a 'sensible' play experience. However, it takes awhile to play the game due to the slow slog of damage and counter healing/protection (this likely depends on the style and familiarity with the spells in the game). So not a game I am likely to own, but is a game I'm willing to play (if I have the time).</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">When I first saw the components for this game, I didn't think I was going to enjoy it.  I'm not a fan of tactical games where players are moving units around the board and rolling dice for attacks.  So it was quite a surprise to me when I ended up really enjoying this game.  The game seems to have good strategic options and lots of replayability.  As far as dueling games go, I really enjoy this one.  Addressing the aforementioned concerns, the board only has 12 spaces, so while there is a bit of tactical maneuvering, this is not the main focus of the game.  And the dice add some randomness without being an overwhelming factor in the game.  This is because the range of numbers on the dice is only 0-2, rather than 1-6, and you're rolling lots of dice, which means over time luck with the dice should just about even out.  I was concerned that having one's entire deck at their disposal would create an analysis paralysis nightmare, but the fact that you can only pick two cards to use each turn actually limits the number of decisions you have to make and helps turns move more quickly than they would if you had access to your whole spell book throughout each turn.  And, obviously, having access to your whole spell book means you don't have to worry about not drawing the cards you need when you need them.  And the ability to customize the spellbooks with a sort of deck-building process really appeals to the CCGer in me.  UPDATE: After playing for the first time with constructed spell books, I still enjoy the game, but it is not a short game.  We played a 2v2 team game that took 2.5 hours, which longer than I like to put into a single game.  This has bumped my score from 8 to 7.  I still enjoyed it, but can't see playing it all that often.  +Nice balance of tactical play and deep strategy. +Spellbook allows access to all of your cards every turn. +Ability to customize your spellbook. +Relatively simple rule set. +Quality art and components. +Lots of room for designers to explore in expansions. +Once players are familiar with the game, it plays quickly.  -Having access to the entire spellbook can be intimidating for new players. -Lots and lots of keywords require lots of flipping through the rulebook.  Really needed to include cheatsheets for these. -A few fiddly rules and ambiguous card interactions (but what expandable card game doesn't have these?)</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">I can see where this is a system that can get a ton of replay, although the spellbook building (which takes place pre-game) looks like it can be lengthy. Which is both a pro and a con.  Not bad, but I don't think I'm going to dive into this one. It's a touch too long and more of a lifestyle game (that you have to play quite a bit to really enjoy) than I'm looking for.  Indifferent</comment>

    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">I really enjoy the strategy in this game but the simplicity and mostly static nature lends to solving the problem and once you understand the solution, it is a matter of turn order.

    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United Kingdom">Rated a 3 after my first play. 3p, took nearly an hour, we all went for the same 'mass cards, get nobles' strat and were relieved when the game ended.   Decided it needed another shot and have put a few hours into Prestige and now the official app. Upgraded to a 6. I think it's too abstract to be a good gateway for most, but as I find myself thinking more about how chips circulate, reserving cards, when/how to go for the higher tier cards right off the bat... I'm finding it a bit more interesting than I previously thought.   In terms of the physical game I still think I'd keep it to 3p max, I expect it to be a bit too slow and chaotic at 4p.</comment>
    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">Simple, quick, and elegant. A great design. A good gateway with some people too. Loses a bit of its fun factor after a few plays though. Still not too bad.</comment>

    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="Denmark">A fun game, but by my account it has an essential flaw. The fact that you can "reserve" op to three cards can spoil a game, if say you need primarily the white (diamonds) for the endgame and not many of them show. If you're unlucky the opponent may be able to just reserve the and lock your chances of winning points.</comment>
    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="Finland">First, I was impressed by the quality of the components. Good thick sturdy cards, above average art, and close to casino grade chips.  Next, I fell in love with the quickly explained rules and fast game play.  Soon, I got disappointed with the lack of dramatic arc. You just kept racing against the others without really building your position. It just boiled down to being faster than your opponents. I would've liked to use my wits as well.</comment>
    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">*Rating based on one play.  Splendor is the definition of a game with a pasted-on theme.  The game is simple and has decent decision points, but also a fairly high degree of luck.  It's short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome, so it has that going for it.  As a light filler goes, you could do worse.  Having said that, I would not pay the $40 MSRP for this game.  The game has clay chips that are very nice, but there aren't that many (40), and the rest of the game is some cards and a handful of chipboard tiles.  There are quite a few unique illustrations on the cards, which probably contributed to the cost, but not all 90 cards have their own illustration.  I would put this at a $30 value.  On top of that, the box has an excessive amount of unused space (probably to justify the price of the game), making it take up far more room than I would like for a light filler.  It takes up more space on the shelf and in the game bag than it deserves.</comment>

    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="Austria">I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  When I approached Splendor for the first time, it had been the new hotness already for quite a while. So maybe I had too high expectations, but I was not particularly impressed by it. I liked it, but it didn't look like anything special to me.   For sure the game is gorgeous looking with its artwork and those chips, but I found the gameplay to be quite shallow and my biggest issue with the game is actually the small entity of each single action, since I have to break my strategy in too many tiny moves... It's strange actually, because I really like Mac Gerdts' rondel for the very same reason. In those systems though, I think, there's greater accomplishments in a lower number of turns and also the fact that there's a board and so much to do helps a lot. In Splendor instead it happens too often that on a turn I might just take a couple of chips and then I'll have to wait a whole lot before I can do what I intended to.  So I really went into Splendor hoping for something a little more interesting. It's a nice game at the end and I'm ok with playing it every now and then, but it's nothing I would consider purchasing or seek to play. I think I'll be fine using someone else's copy.</comment>

Why it's previously-owned: Yedo has a similar building-up-each-turn-to-put-out-a-bigger-and-better-show/mission mechanic to it.  This game's theme was a major strike against it, and with Yedo to take its place, I don't think it'll be missed.   I traded this away for A Few Acres of Snow.</comment>

This may be fine for the deck-builders who are happy to customs but the the likes of me who has little interest in this,or just a casual gamer, it make shte gme almost worthless. I'll persevere a while though. And an extra mark for the implementation of the theme.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Greece">I have only played the introductory quest thrice. Lot's of fases but not that many decisions. And it's actually pretty easy to win, unless I'm playing it wrong (there's a snare card that you can use in the introductory quest, that imobilizes your engaged enemy you attach it to, for the rest of the game. And also late in the game, you have maybe 5-6 allies open together with your heroes...).</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Germany">Solid LCG. Not so much fun with playing solo but 2-player is nice. I dont really like the deckbuilding aspect too much, because of which I prefer pre-made decks.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Canada">Constructing decks before playing is not my thing. Honing decks after playing is not my thing.  Having said that, this is a lovely looking game with a very interesting play order. It is nice that it can be played coop or solo and can easily be played in 30 to 45 minutes on easy level.  Playing one-handed seems very difficult without constructing decks (see first comment).  As the challenge seems to come before the game is played, it isn't a game I want to continually play.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">2 plays / 5 players (1 play w/expansion)  LIKE: Quick, even with full 5 players. Feels good to create efficient routes. DISLIKE: A little light. Dice rolling slows things down. Player interaction could be lacking with less players.  OVERALL: Ok game for a light group, but not much player interaction except for the occasional inadvertent blocking. I don't see how this can be exciting with less players.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Finland">Year 2014 seems to be the year of worker movement games. I quite like the mechanic of moving your worker in a grid of action spaces. This really forces you to plan ahead to gain synergy from your moves.  However, there is one thing that I am not so fond of. This is the abrupt game ending. First, all players spend several rounds gathering speed, then everyone makes the final rush for diamonds which lasts for 3-4 rounds and then... game over. It is just my personal opinion but I rather scored points along the way working towards the final climax. I want to make decisions whether to score points now or risk my chances and try to score big in the end.  Anyways, solid mechanics and fun "plan ahead to synergise" type of game. Refreshing after classical worker placement and engine building games, I would say.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">*Rating based on one play.  I'd heard a lot of buzz about this game, but I found it to be a bit lackluster.  I feel like the way the game works with leaving your assistants behind on locations you visit encourages players to work out an optimized circuit of 3-5 tiles and simply visit them over and over again, which doesn't make for interesting play.  Granted I have only one play to base this observation on and so I could be completely wrong, but the game didn't really excite me in any other aspect to motivate me to test out my theory further.  I can't really put my finger on why it fell flat for me (beyond seeming to encourage repetitive strategies).  It has a lot of things I normally like in games: resource management, limited randomness, multiple paths to victory, some engine building and power comboing.  One thing that did sour me was the fact that I could see the game was won 2-3 turns in advance, and there was nothing I could do to make up the gap at that point.  It removed any suspense from the end game.  In the end, I guess I just didn't find the game's unique characteristic (the movement mechanics) interesting, so there was nothing to set the game apart from the dozens of other Euros I've played.</comment>

The artwork is quite pleasant and production quality is decent. The rules are reasonably well written.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Greece">Light eurogame where players travel around Istanbul with their cart, buying and selling goods. The first person who collects a certain amount of rubies is the winner. There are 4-5 different ways to collect a ruby so each player can select a different strategy. The game is tight and the player who manages to make better use of his action will be the winner. We played a 4 player game and it took us a bit less than an hour.</comment>

Just wasn't that interesting and failed to really impress us. Sold since we had no interest in playing it again.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="Cyprus">A good euro. Nothing special. What irks me is that there is limited interaction and market barrows are far more important than the craft buildings.</comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="">I was certainly looking forward to playing La Granja given the recent buzz about the game. Perhaps my expectations were too high.    I found La Granja to be a well designed complex resource conversion challenge...that really was not much more than that.  It seemed surprisingly thin thematically, perhaps because it used an "all different resources are denoted by your color marker" approach to "tally" your resources.    Suggesting that this game is similar to Agricola, I believe, is misleading.  In Agricola, the central thematic focus is to build and improve your farm and farm home.  In Agricola, you often feel like you ARE farming (since you actually simulate sowing and growing crops), that you HAVE a farm family (since they become your workers), and that these animals ARE your animals (since you build pastures for them and see them in the fields).    In La Granja the overriding desire at all times is to gain resources to satisfy or fill "orders" for goods to get more and more VP chits. You acquire and "tally" resources on your farm and use your tallied resources to deliver and fill orders.  Dry.    Agricola is fundamentally and inextricably a celebration of the worker placement mechanic.  La Granja is, at best, an oblique take on worker placement.  La Granja felt to me like a curious collection of mechanics that each round, we were asked to participate in, but these mechanics really had marginal thematic connection.   I found it curious that La Granja borrowed the spatial "bump other players off if they are on lower numbers" board from Feld's Luna.  Did it work in La Granja?  For me, not so much.   Yes, the "four uses for each card" was interesting, and I think the designer provided appreciable complexity and replayability to his design, but I found the game to be just too dry and "unrelated mechanics" filled to want to play the game again.  Have to give the game a 6.</comment>

    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="">Reasonably amusing, but the map is much too large. It should have been constructed of tiles and expanded as the players needed more space, to keep people together and in active conflict. As it was, in my one play, we had only one town on the whole map with two competing cubes, and we each had a small stack of special action chips allowing us to swap the order of town control cubes - rendering it a pointless exercise to compete over.  I am fairly sure that this is partly due to us playing poorly, but with a tighter map we would have been forced into playing properly and we would have had a better time of it.  The game ended just as we were starting to accomplish things and get to a position where we could start to compete for territory. But, if it hadn't stopped there, probably there would have been a risk of experienced players being able to max out most of their upgrades.  So - decent game, but poorly balanced to create the best gaming experience. Unless you're all experienced players of Hansa Teutonica, the quality of play will degrade.</comment>

    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="Finland">One of the most aesthetically pleasing games. A carefully handcrafted board with real polished stones can be a true gem. I would like to own one just for the looks.  When it comes to the game itself, the rules are deceivingly simple. Just play a stone on any vacant intersection on the board. Of course there are some illegal moves (the ko rule, or suicide). However, once you start playing that assessing the situation becomes very very hard. After several of plays it might still be a bit unclear whether you do have an area in your control or not.  I can clearly see why Go can capture the entire life of individuals. There are so many plays in it, and unlike in chess I reckon that memorising certain plays is not that big part of a game. Moreover, threat can come from all directions, not just one and the situation on board develops over a longer span of time.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United Kingdom">It's hard to give this a rating.  I don't enjoy it as such, but it is clearly a good game.  I don't think that it has any obvious flaws apart from the fact that it's VERY abstract and if you don't like really dry abstracts then it's one to avoid.  And this certainly is drier than most abstracts, for my taste.    Personally, I'd much rather play Yinsh, Hive or Billabong, but I can't say that this is worth less than 6.  I simply don't enjoy it enough to rate it higher than that.  Certainly a brain-burner, and having played it I can see where some of the ideas in games like Through the Desert and other Knizia's in particular come from.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="Wales">This beautiful complex worker placement game feels like a step forward from Stone Age and Ninjato, with its multiple paths to victory, story-evoking theme, and clever new mechanic whereby your workers die of old age scoring you victory points. It's a bit of a time investment, but doesn't outstay its welcome. I think this is a really excellent new game that brings something unique to the genre.  Update: Didn't hold my interest in the long run. Enjoyed 6 games very much, but they all started to feel very similar, despite trying the different strategies. Traded away, for Troyes, which is a fabulous game.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">Gamer friends classify this as a solid game with nothing too original. I think it does have a few interesting new twists - not the death of meeples which folks seem to highlight, but the way you select resources to take actions. I like it but the over all impression is a large number of completely disconnected areas - a set of mechanic vectors jutting off in opposite directions. Despite that, it's a fine game in flow that I would play again, just not one that I feel I need to own.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">Good game but not my favorite.  There are different engines with interconnecting pieces but they're not all equal and they're not all engaging.  Just doesn't grab me.  Maybe I need to play it more and see how it goes, but it wasn't a great experience and I don't feel that burning desire to immerse myself.  *shrug*  Maybe just not for me.  10/09/13:  I'm trying to figure out why I don't like this one.  It's a euro.  It's got an interconnected engine.  The engine is variable and there are a few different directions.  I *should* like this more than I do.  Maybe it's because the different engines are unequal.  Maybe because I haven't seen someone win without going heavy on the market.  Maybe it's because there actually aren't that many different engines (travel, market, chronicle, guys on the board).  Maybe it's because the first thing we do each round is the family action to get more guys.  Maybe it's because putting the wrong guy at the wrong place is ridiculously punishing.  Maybe it's because the end of the game just rushes into place.  I dunno, but I really am not a fan of this game.  I'll play it, but it's just not for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="">Don't hate it, but it's pretty dry and tense, and the variance is unexciting variance.  For this kind of thing, probably well done, nice theme.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United Kingdom">Lots of ways to score, resource cubes to spend, always wanting to do more than you are able, minimal player interaction (the usual taking stuff before an opponent), and a rustic medieval German setting.  If only there had been buildings to build, this would have been the archetypal euro game.    That's perhaps a little unfair on Village.  The idea of time passing and death periodically claiming your workers is quite nicely implemented.  The sort of inverse worker placement - you take off a cube to perform an action - works well to limit the number of times each action can be taken and create tension.  And the game is quite faithful to its hackneyed theme.  Would I play it again?  Ye-e-es.  Production quality is excellent and the artwork is pleasingly evocative.  </comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">Played with the expansion, and it seemed like a pretty long worker placement, but we also messed up several rules. The stress of trying to balance when to kill your workers was much more interesting than just "feed them." Overall, interesting, and would maybe try again. </comment>

Certain route once the first player starts to build it, will block the other players from ever to reach their destination city. So in that sense, it's a rather cut throat game at the initial stage.  The multi use of cards to supplement a Color needed in the ferries and Murmansk route is a very interesting idea.  Overall, a good investment for beginners. Retains the flavour of TTR and still challenging to play.</comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">1st play: Quite a cool game, different race powers, shared pool of cards, drafting some buildings and getting an engine going. The art is appealing and the mechanics are interesting. The game could really use a solid player aid to help learning. Also, first plays can be swingy, more plays may help mitigate this, or it might come down to card draw.  2nd play: I played a different race this time and figuring out how to combo the cards of the race was fun.  Avoiding the pitfalls and trying to build an engine was cool, but it was a little frustrating working to put it all together only to have a critical building killed at the wrong time.  Two of the people at the table felt like their powers were very boring, and that level of disparity between races ends up making the game not as fun for me.

Cards are multi-purpose, which mitigates the luck of the draw.  Lack the resources to build that one, then you can raze it to gain the resources necessary to build something else.  Also, with some of the cards you can make a deal to increase production of one resource. In the time honoured fashion, the decisions in this game are about how best to use your cards in hand and on the table to develop a resource (and then victory point) engine.    Unlike most engine builders, Imperial Settlers has an element of direct interaction in that it is possible to raze opponents' buildings to gain resources and damage their engines. The extent to which razing is used to gather the resources you need or to bash whoever you perceive to be the leader is an interesting judgement.   There are four factions in the box, each with its own deck.  They certainly play quite differently. A question in my mind is about how strongly the cards of a faction steer your play in one direction or another.      I have quite enjoyed playing Imperial Settlers.  However, while it all works smoothly, there is a sense of deja vu about this game.  It lacks something fresh to make it really stand out.  The computer civ game look of the artwork is quite jolly.  However, the tiny text on the cards was a poor design choice.  This is an interactive game and I need to know what the cards in your tableau can do.  </comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Denmark">The 2-player games I've played have all been onesided affairs. When one player speeds up his opponent will often be behind the rest of the game.  3-player games are more balanced, but seem to long.</comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Finland">I like the rule, that you can't just concentrate on one thing but your final score is determined by the weakest link of your team. The game also plays relatively fast. The only bigger complaint is about the graphics. The board and the tiles simply look boring.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Wales">I found this another bulky design by Feld. This is set-collection in a variety of different forms with no thematic integration. It looks lovely, works well, and is nicely strategic, but sometimes less is more. This game is not as unwieldy as Bora Bora, but it is not as streamlined as Notre Dame, In the Year of the Dragon, Castles of Burgundy, or Rialto. The Mancala mechanic is fabulous - why Feld feels the need to throw so many eggs into one basket is beyond me though - a simpler use of the Mancala/Rondel system would have kept me much happier. Luna is still number-one Feld for me, which is kind of a shame because it's the least obviously "Feldian". Still, if you enjoy his other games, Trajan is a sure-fire hit. </comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">A good game, but fails to reach greatness in my mind.  The mancala mechanic is interesting, but most of the time the color of the markers in the mancala doesn't matter.  The goal tiles aren't that interesting or varied.  The restriction on where you can place the Trajan tiles on your board feels overly restrictive.  I enjoy the game, but wouldn't rank it as one of Feld's best.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Either you get it, or you don't. I don't. High risk choices that will probably result in wasted turns, or safe choices just to avoid impending disasters with little payback. Frustrating.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Spain">Feld recently designed a series of games that somehow feel similar (some people call them "point salad" games). Some of them are excellent (Macao is my favorite), others are very good, including Trajan. I may eventually get my own copy.  Update (12/2014): I got it in a trade.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Having played twice, it was better the 2nd game.  Overall though - I don't think this is Feld's best.  There's a decent amount of luck, and the various different action paths are tricky.  The game is decent tho, as long as you house-rule the end game to give all players equal turns.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United Kingdom">Nice mechanisms, especially the mancala action selection. On my first play, it felt pretty long and I knew I was out of contention pretty early on, which meant it dragged a little. But Id certainly play again and hope to do better, investing in +2s and more Trajan tiles to make my actions more efficient.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Finland">+ Mancala mechanism makes the decision making difficult and rewarding. Colours on the discs increases this. + After the bonus tiles runs out the decision making gets easier, since the colours on the discs don't matter any longer. - A bunch of mechanisms tied together with very loose theme.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United Kingdom">I tend to think of "point salad" as a disparaging term, and Trajan is as point-salady as they come. It's essentially a set of 6 areas (mini-games) tied together by a mancala that controls which of the areas you can take actions in. But Feld knows how to make a truly compelling game out of it. Key to what makes the game interesting is the variable set-up and the variable set of demands and bonus tiles that come out each turn. These, combined with what your opponents are doing and the disposition of cubes on the mancala, dictate your strategy which can be quite different from game to game. While the game doesn't exactly drip theme, each of the areas makes sense thematically.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Canada">Another Feld point extravaganza. Fairly simple when you break it down into its individual pieces as the complexity comes from the number of different choices and combinations you can create. The action selection method is particularly interesting and strategic but can potentially lead to some serious AP.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Interesting Mancala style mechanism to identify which actions are available to you in this worker placement game set with a Roman Theme.</comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Wales">A great game of optimisation. This is worker-placement through and through, with very little feeling of theme. There is nice artwork throughout, but you are entirely absorbed by the mathematics of it all, not by the "world of the game". It's very clever, works well, and enjoyable.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">3 plays / 3, 4 players  LIKE: Hard decisions, every option is good. Interesting mechanisms with the sliding rails. The personal board is tidy yet holds lots of information. Lots of strategies once you get to know the big combos.  DSLIKE: Unforgiving game, but that makes it interesting. Experienced players have a great advantage. First player has large advantage. Difficult to catch up when behind. Points go over 200, so counting can be fiddly and math heavy.  OVERALL: The game was quite abstract for a train game, but that doesn't bother me. Some scores compound round after round, so those are the ones to go after, making strategy limited to certain choices. After a few plays with some pointers, the game is growing on me.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">Its a Euro-worker placement game - and by that I mean it has resources in the form of tracks and workers that are used to take actions. The personal board that tracks your railroad building is first rate albeit nearly overwhelming with options. That's one of the reasons the game takes a bit of time to get off the table, but I don't think it overstays its welcome: there's alot of game to enjoy here. However, I do take pause with some aspects. As fun as the building rails system is - and how counter intuitive! - it still feels like once you play the game a few times, the surprises are essentially over. To be sure there's lots of things yet to explore at that point - but you know the paths of victory and what's left is nuances, not revolutions.  It is *very* good for all that - better with perhaps 3-4 and not 5 (the game just lasts too long). The components and general design are very polished. So I like it and would suggest playing at least a few more times.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">*Rating based on one play.  Interesting worker placement game with lots of paths to victory.  Requires a lot of counting, which means a lot of opportunities for miscounting.</comment>

The actions are quite limited, and there are times you feel you are making a slow crawl, but then you pull off a power turn or two, and it's quite satisfying. After having played German Railroads, I have little interest in playing the Russian boards.</comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">A fun euro to be sure, but it's a little distressing that the first three actions of each turn seem to be pretty scripted in a 4 player game (engineer purchase, money acquisition, and dual worker pickup). The opportunity cost of choosing when to be first/second player is important then, and multiple paths seem to be valid strategies as in my game I saw a heavy tech specialization lose barely to a heavy rail specialization.   The theme is paper thin at best, and really is kind of just pasted on, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless and plays pretty quick for what it is. I'd play it again for sure.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United Kingdom">Russian Railroads does have trains with numbers that denote how far they can travel, in the style of 18xx games.  There the similarity to 18xx ends and a fairly abstract optimisation game of development along four tracks - three of them railways, one industry - begins. A focus on one track over others provides the strategic options.  There's a hatful of opportunities to score victory points. Worker placement is the main mechanism and, as in the best games of this sort, throws up some real dilemmas of prioritisation.   Russian Railroads is handsomely produced with artwork that adds a thick gloss of theme.  </comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">It's a good game, but has limited strategies which, I fear, limit it's replayability.  The game is also pretty unforgiving to those who don't see one of those strategies early.</comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Cyprus">It's too early to say for sure but it may be the best worker placement i have played for some time. I like the few components and the limited duration. Scoring seems balanced and it's simple to teach. Caverna and this are mutually exclusive IMHO. Russian railways doesn't really add anything new. </comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="">Not entirely sure why this game is so highly ranked on BGG at the moment.  It seems like a nice enough "puzzle" wherein you use very straightforward worker placements to advance markers of different colors on your player card in order to earn victory points each round.    Presumably, the thrill is in figuring out how to squeeze out the most VP's by manipulating different colored markers (track markers they say) better than the other players. Each player quietly does their manipulations on their boards with the other players not really watching.  Theme is strangely close to nonexistent in this game, really an afterthought. Interactivity feels nonexistent, and curiously, lower than your average worker placement game.  Still, it is sort of fun in a mellow way.  There might be some replayability here as you experiment with manipulating your markers from game to game, though actually, I cannot envision much fun in doing those experiments.  I might play one more time I suppose.   </comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Germany">The archetypical railroad game: A working theme, mechanics that appear to be complex but are rather simple, "block this" interaction, nice design and a certain amount of boredom.   I like the general idea, but having a game where you block other's choices just to realize that in the end, everyone gets VP no matter what the players actually do is not that amazing. It's not worth the hype, but not a bad game.</comment>

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="Wales">This is a great theme marred by rather uninspiring gameplay and ugly aesthetics (much like its precursor Suburbia). There is nothing WRONG with the game mechanics - it all works well and there are lots of strategic decisions to be made - but there isn't much of a sense of fun in the game, which is crazy considering the fascinating theme. Some nice artwork would have helped - why does everything have to look so grey and boring? I preferred it to Suburbia, but if I was to play a tile-laying game along these lines, I would still opt for Glen More every time.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United Kingdom">Fun game, a light game with some strategy.

HE could finally impress HER with his Tetris-skills and create the optimal room plan, SHE could design the perfect harmony between living room curtains and grotto lighting. BOTH could discuss whether it might be a good idea to have the theater room directly adjacent to the kitchen. After the game is over, they could go back to their real home and, even though it will be much less impressive than the fantasy castle they just created, they will still happily agree that their fictitious castle was obviously MUCH better than that hell of a garden massacre that Liz and Pete were building.

Looking forward to playing again now that I have a better idea of what to expect.  2nd play: The game made more sense the second time around, with room bonuses tying together better and a set of 4 very appealing castles.

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="Belgium">Build your castle! Kind of a strategic puzzle to solve for players. I do like it, just think it is a bit to expensive since the components look rather...Cheap.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="England">I'm not a big fan of co-operative games. This is one of the best (and has a very clever card recycling mechanism which keeps the pressure on the players) but it's still a co-operative game</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Co-op, but can be very susceptible to an alpha gamer just directing everyone else's moves.  Game can be very dictated by the flow of the infection deck.Clever mechanics and nice mix of special abilities though.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="Canada">I need to play this more to properly evaluate it, but so far it looks like the best co-op game ever made, and second place isn't even close.  Great theme, good components, tough game system, smooth gameplay, and looks like some interesting expansions in the pipeline.  I should add that I'm not really into co-op games, so maybe giving it only a 7.5 doesn't do it justice.  Own the [boardgame=40849]On the Brink[/boardgame], [boardgame=137136]In the Lab[/boardgame], and [boardgame=168703]State of Emergency[/boardgame] expansions.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">A co-op game that is fun and relatively easy to learn and plays in a short amount of time. Each game tends to be very different and they are usually tense to the end. It's fun to give each disease a name and then watch it spread or try to cure it. The city spots are way too small for all the stuff that can go on them, though; a single pawn is larger than a city space!</comment>

    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United Kingdom">Good solid game, the daddy of dungeon crawlers, I never played the previous edition and have played a few games on the 2nd, I love the variety of the missions and the fact that you play the campaign, component quality is 5 star (out of 5) but it takes a long time to setup sometimes it is overwhelming looking at all the components</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="Poland">Great game. Amazing quality of the pieces, rich story and fun gameplay. A bit dissapointing that it doesn't work well for a 2 player game but will have to try out the no-overlord variant.</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">Fun but a little light.</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">A decent dungeon crawler, but a bit too much work to set up and tear down, and isn't very streamlined.  Also, because maps are known ahead of time, no feeling of exploration.  Surprisingly, the co-op and single player variants are more enjoyable, because of the exploration element.</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="Spain">El referente entre los dungeoncrawlers. </comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">I really enjoy this game. Descent 2.0 has wonderful customization, well done minis, its fun, its exciting, but can be unbalanced at times. As long as it keeps making it to the table and I still want to play it I'll keep it. </comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="">The base edition can be pretty boring for the Overlord as they have no possible way to win any encounter, even when using bizarre strategies. The game is NOT a dungeon crawler or even a tactical game. It's a racing game with asymmetrical play as every scenario is about completing objectives faster. That said, the combat system and items are really fun and the hero classes add a lot of replayability.  Update 2016: If you download the android app for this game and run THOSE campaigns, this easily gets a +1 to its score!</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="Spain">Cool ameritrash. </comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">This game looks amazing; a great traditional dungeon crawl. Update: I replaced with Level 7: Omega Protocol. I still like Descent a lot, but I just favor a sci-fi theme.</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="Greece">This 2nd edition is very different from the 1st. 2nd edition is designed to be played as a campaign of small scenarios where heroes and the overlord upgrade themselves between missions. I like the new combat system that uses defence dice. The game box is smaller and the same is true for the scenarios and playing time. Rules are simpler too.  I really didn't like the new LOS system. Seems so stupid, so I am using the classic LOS rules from 1st edition.</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">I liked HeroQuest as a kid and this seemed like a more grown up version of that little nostalgia bomb.  Basically, it did exactly that.  I haven't been able to get it on the table with my regular group (for a full 4 player + 1 overlord game).  My only plays are with my wife (me as overlord, and she will play 2-3 heroes).  I had the rules screwed up for the first couple of tries and my wife (I had monsters taking 2 attack actions when they didn't move... whoops!).  She got understandably frustrated since basically, she couldn't win.  We tried again with the correct rules and it went a lot better.   I think that the one sided beating she was getting when I wasn't playing the mosters correctly kind of soured her on the game, so it might be a while before it sees the table again.

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">Tentative rating after one play using introductory rules.  The introductory game is a superior Risk-like wargame but one with more interesting decisions to be made.  Am looking forward to the standard game.  I'm guessing that my rating will go up with addition of event cards, characters, minions, and a more complex Fellowship movement system.  All in all, I am very impressed.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="Finland">Ok, the 1st play is under my belt. Can't really give a honest opinion about the game yet but it sure seems to have some good qualities. Basically the game is like Risk but when you add the strategic planning of how to manage your resources the game gets more depth. Should you concentrate on mustering troops and leading 'em into war or should you try to finish the game by deciding the fate of the Ring.  But I really must say that you have to be familiar with the story or you won't have a clue what's going on.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="Denmark">The LotR theme is very well woven into this game, resembling very much the actual situation known from the books. The components are beautifully made and if you like detailed plastic miniatures, then you'll drool happily over what you get here. The mechanics works well, you draw cards (random factor), roll dice (random factor) and then decide what you do based on what you get, which makes strategic planning and choices possible. Combat boils down to a simple dice rolling mechanic. This is the type of game where a good strategy will win the game only occasionally. There is unfortunately too much 'luck' involved for me to find it really awesome.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United Kingdom">I suspect that this game is ultimately one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced.  While I love everything else about it, the endgame is shocking - Fellowship journey into Mordor feels like a luck of the draw issue and after the ridiculous amount of effort it takes to get there that's not good enough.  I'm really unhappy about that because the rest of the game really works.  Trade: Includes battles of the third age expansion and I would rather swap the whole lot (battles of the third age is in the main box and does not have its own packaging)</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="">The setup alone for War of Ring was extremely complex, and the game play only continued that trend. A few moments of geopolitical genius flared during our time in Middle Earth, but we were ultimately left wanting.  I hope a few more times playing will change my opinion of this great looking game.</comment>

Like to play it with 3 and dont like with 2,because it becomes similar to chess and not friendly to small mistakes and with 2 is required to disturb the opponent more.

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="Finland">The merit of this game is the interesting dice and worker placement mechanics. Otherwise it's a solid middle weight eurogame. Prone to induce analysis paralysis towards the end of the game when the number of option grow hundred fold.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">*Rating based on one play.  A very Feld-like Euro game with interesting dice mechanics.  It's a bit more cutthroat with the dice stealing than I prefer in my cube-pushers, but I enjoyed it more than I had expected.  While I need a few more plays to firm up my opinion on it, right now it feels like a good game, but not a great one.</comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="">The theme is garbage but the game play makes up for it. If this game was more heavy into theme, I would give it a way higher rating.  EDIT: After playing this many times, I think it's still a good game. BUT... first player advantage pisses me off, the player who starts the game gets an extra turn being first, which is huge. </comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">2-4(3)  You know, I liked it, but our first play felt awfully long, with eight rounds and 18 dice to spend. There's an interesting bit of gamesmanship in trying to determine your opponent's scoring card. But really, the core of the game is in the dice and the use of them. It's not really more complex than Kingsburg, but it feels a lot more meaningful. There are a lot of options here, with battling events, trade cards, principal buildings, etc., as opposed to Kingsburg, in which your options are pretty well constrained by your dice and there is often a "clear" "best option". Troyes will have some AP for this, which extends the game, but I think otherwise it's well-balanced, with some mechanisms (namely, buying dice) that really bring something to the table. Also, there is a downside in combo (or trade) spamming, in which a single trade card will get throttled all game, essentially eliminating the variability from the other trade cards.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United Kingdom">There's a lot going on in Troyes.  Combine that with a new set of icons to learn and a fresh twist of the allocate dice to do stuff genre and there's a bit of a learning curve.  Get beyond that and you'll find a game that challenges you to make the best use of three resources -  dice, money and influence - and gives you a variable set of tools (the various profession cards) to play with.  My one concern is that some combinations are very powerful.  The last game I played was a first encounter with the Monk + Sculptor juggernaut.  The end result wasn't close.   I rather like the Medieval-style artwork.  The production quality is excellent.     </comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Denmark">So, I am rating this game after one play.   The theme is so thick, and the gameplay is superb. But boy, is the game rough. We are not used to that amount of player interaction, especially not of the backstabbing kind.  I had a weird feeling after completing the first game. Joy and sorrow, but such is the game of thrones.  I really want to give the game an 8, and I hope the next game will upgrade the score, but for now 7 is the feeling the one game left me with.  My wife would probably give it a higher score, she is a great AGOT geek, and she actually won our first game.</comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="United States">+ Great tie-in with the theme; Plenty of room for crafty maneuvers. - Must have a high player count to make the game really work.   Why it's previously-owned: It just never got played.  I don't have the right group to play this; you need 5 other people who want to hunker down in a highly-contentious, back-stabbing combative game. This was part of the big Dune CCG trade.</comment>
    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="">Great game if you have 3 or more and don't mind backstabbing your friends!

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Singapore">Excellent game whose focus is on the diplomacy and intrigue and the combat is not luck based. The theme comes out in spades and the negotiations breeds intrigue as the game has no currency to give, just promises. The downsides to game is the time it takes to play, the base game needs 6 if one is totally into balance and the game works a lot more with people who like to negotiate. That being said I still feel it is a good game, can't recommend it more.  </comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Brazil">Good thematic game, but too long. But I realy liked it, feels good about the book series. The real problem here is that the game is too concentrated in battles, and even with the mecanics of the bid for power, influence, and the invasion from the north, the game is strictly focused in battle and area control. Works well just with 3 or 6 players.</comment>
    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Australia">The game looks good - it's a bit busy in places and is certainly an FFG game with all the chits and bits.   Mechanically, its interesting - I take if you played it a lot, or very deliberately, there are best plays early, but I've specifically refrained from knowing a lot about the game so I can enjoy it two or three times a year.   The 'intrigue' angle is fairly weak to be honest. I think the game is all about hedging and timing your run, which some might say A Song of Ice and Fire is all about, but I think a lot of people expect backstab-counterbackstab, and you just can't recover easily. </comment>
    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Sweden">Really good thematic backstabbing-game, similar to Diplomacy. Only bad thing is that it's a very long game and can be frustrating at times.</comment>
    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="United States">Only played it a couple times, and had the fortune of playing mostly with people familiar with the series, so getting into character was part of what made it enjoyable.  Solid mechanisms behind it too, but I don't think I'd enjoy it nearly as much with players not knowledgeable about the personalities and houses of Westeros.  Would certainly be willing to play it again, but no compulsion to own a copy for myself.</comment>

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">2 plays / 3,4 players  LIKE: Very long term strategic. I enjoy the resource wheel because it has a bit of push-your-luck to obtain that one extra resource from the wheel, hoping no one takes that wood! Nice spacial puzzle when placing settlements.   DISLIKE: Chit intensive. Low interaction, but the resource wheel is enough. Brain intensive, so some AP. First time players will not know all the card combos. Some strategies don't change from game to game, therefore if an optimal path is found, the game could get repetitive.  OVERALL: Similar to Le Havre, good game, but can be long. It's a lesser known title than the other Uwe Rosenberg titles. There are two sets of scenarios to keep the game fresh. I still prefer Le Havre, but will play this anytime. </comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="Canada">Light worker placement with card set collection.  This 2-4 player game is about collecting resources in order to acquire buildings (which are points), and cards (which are minimal immediate benefits and potentially large endgame points), while maintaining a steady food supply in order to feed your meeples (people).  The game mechanic is the tried (tired?) and true worker placement, and the options are: 1) resources, of which there several- wood, clay, stone, and gold- in that order of value and difficulty to obtain, 2) food, which is needed to feed your workers each and every round, 3) farms, which provide a guaranteed food income each round, 4) tools, which increase the probability of your obtaining resources/food, 5) buildings, which can be built for points using specified resources, 6) "loveshack", which produces an extra worker, 7) cards, which again require resources, and which give small immediate benefits, but are really collected for endgame considerations- there are several different types of point modifiers based on number of endgame buildings, workers, etc., as well as set collection of different culture cards.  In order to obtain resources, the new (old) in vogue dice-rolling mechanic is used- roll a dice for each worker placed in an area and count the number of dice pips.  Divide this number by the appropriate factor (ie: 2 for food, 3 for wood, 4 for clay, etc, rounding down), and that's how many resources you obtain.  You can modify the results with tools, with the tool value being added to the number of dice pips.  Obviously, this can result in some spectacularly good or bad results on any given roll- in some ways this is thematic, but...  Turn order rotates each round, and as with all placement games, it's always better to go first rather than last. You need to feed your people each round (1 food per person) or you lose 10 points per round- although this is apparently a viable strategy to ignore feeding and take the 10 point hit.  The game ends when you run out of cards or a stack of buildings is depleted.  The components are great, and the game seems to scale well (well not really, it plays quite well as a 2-player, 3-player is OK, and 4-player has all of the issues outlined below in abundance, and is no longer playable as such IMO).  Now my issues with the game: 1) it is FAR TOO LONG for what it is, and 2) turn order is a bit too significant a factor- there is no turn-order change placement like in Caylus, Age of Empires III, and Pillars of the Earth.  Basically if you randomly start the game as 4th player, good luck to you, and oh by the way, if you're not a lucky dice roller, good night!  If this game played in 45 minutes it would be a pretty decent albeit light game.  If there hadn't been about 10 games of this nature released before it, it might be a really good game.  As it is, it's a very derivative, lengthy luckfest.  That said, the theme and ease of gameplay MIGHT still get it to the table occasionally, but again the length is the biggest issue.  If I want to play a light worker placement game, I'll go Pillars of the Earth everytime, hands down.  Edit: OK, well now I've played this about 230 times on BSW (I only play 2-player), and with about a 70% win percentage and nothing close to lucky rolls (I suck at rolling, even computer generated rolls!), I have to admit there's a pretty good amount of strategy hidden in this game, for 2-players at least.  I'd probably rate this about a 8 for 2-players.   Own the [boardgame=107576]Style is the Goal[/boardgame] expansion and the [boardgame=147541]Casino[/boardgame] mini-expansion.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">2 plays / 4 players  LIKE: Excellent gateway game. Tiny bit of engine building with a lot of push-your-luck mechanisms and dice rolling. I like the arc of the game from getting resources to scoring points on the cards. Many ways to mitigate the dice rolls. DISLIKE: Randomness in the dice. A little on the lighter side of the weight spectrum.  OVERALL: Good to great game, depending on the level the players are at. </comment>
    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">After a few more plays, my rating is dropping a bit. I feel I've seen the paths through this game and I'm slowly losing interest. Also, it drags on a bit long - depending on the players of course. Still, it remains enjoyable because it's so much fun - worker placement and rolling dice in an extremely nice production.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United Kingdom">Although it's got dice and performance is directly attributable to pips rolled, given that a lot of dice are rolled over a game they tend to average out quite well giving rise to the better strategy. The underlying game is strong and works well with 2, 3 or 4 players. </comment>

The game doesn't feel complete if you don't play the campaign, so I definitely recommend doing the campaign. Edit Mar 2016: Started a campaign, getting through 2 games. That's a much better way to play, as it adds some extra thought to how to play, in the form of good and bad consequences.</comment>

Permite un mont&#243;n de combos interesantes combinando los innumerables personajes que vienen (al menos en la edici&#243;n Kickstarter).  No se trata de un dungeon crawl al uso (aunque pueda parecerlo). En realidad las misiones son sencillas y todos los jugadores compiten entre ellos por cumplirlas antes que nadie. Una vez comienza la partida todo esta permitido (incluso atacar/robar a otros jugadores). Hay que hacer lo que sea por convertirse en el nuevo se&#241;or todopoderoso de la ciudad de Arcadia!!  Muy divertido!</comment>
    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="United States">Game play is pretty good.  Not complicated and could do a game fairly fast.  Though it does NOT really feel like a big adventure/quest/crawl.    Not digging the cartoony figs with big heads.</comment>

    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="Canada">Arcadia Quest is a fun and light "all-out-brawl" sort of game. You maneuver your clan of 4 heroes and attack monsters and other clans, while collecting items and gold.  By far the funnest part of the game is spending your hard-earned gold at the end of a particular quest to get improved gear. The gear is varied and remains exciting throughout the campaign.  The biggest down-side to the game is the amount of luck involved in attacking and defending. Every time you roll a critical, you get to roll the dice again, and if you get another one, you roll again, and again. Sometimes you can cause devastating damage just out of sheer luck, and this has turned off a lot of people who I have played with.  If you are OK with the possibility of dying frequently due to your lack of luck or due to the incredible luck of your opponents, then this game should be a worthy addition to your library. </comment>
    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="United States">This looks like a really fun competitive dungeon crawl. It's nice because you can bring as much "take that" to the game as you want.Going to play it with 2, but probably really shines with 3 or 4. </comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">2 plays / 2,4 players  LIKE: Many options, and some possibilities for interesting combinations. The map is the best part, as it feels like a combative map without actual combat and possibly fight yourself. Good variability with the tracks. Innovative card management.  DISLIKE: Many rules that could easily be forgotten. The theme is dry. Rampant analysis paralysis can leave me feeling fatigued. The diamond and bookkeeping track on the personal boards feel disjointed.  OVERALL: This is a solid, crunchy game. With more players the decisions are even more tense. I didn't feel this was a stock game, but more of a combination of hand management and worker placement game. Lots of little mechanics that come together and offer room for exploration.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Finland">2016-03-10 There are so many things going on simultaneously in Mombasa that the game requires your full attention all the time. In most other games, you only worry about the moves until the end of the round, or until the very beginning of the next round at maximum. Normally it is your general strategy that gives you the roadmap beyond the tactical horizon and you you do not need extrapolate too deep into the future. In Mombasa however, the tactical horizon spans over two rounds at least. This is because, the actions you play this round will be next available to you in two rounds or later. So planning your actions poses a challenge, and the game is guaranteed to give many of those 'Oh s***!' moments when you realise you've messed up. You also need to have a more or less fixed strategy at the start because altering the course of the ship on the fly might prove challenging if the actions you need are not available to you at that very moment. And since the game lasts only 7 rounds, waiting 2 rounds for the actions does not sound like a winning plan.  In practice this means, that the first few plays are strictly for learning. Sure, there is player interaction in form of blocking and speculation, but most of your energy will be consumed elsewhere. After learning how to phase your actions thus getting into the "zone", the game transforms into a an interactive mix of action selection, area control, majority speculation and worker placement mechanics. A notable feature of the game is that there is no score track so players can only speculate who is winning. Almost all information is public but it is spread across such a big surface that there is little point of trying to keep track of all points except in the tightest of play groups. And still the value of shares can change either way, so the game is better played with a gut feeling.  The long learning curve and the need to plan many moves ahead send Mombasa to the heavier end of the spectrum. It is not the behemoth from your worst nightmares, but it still a beast to reckon, I would say. For gamers who fancy a challenge, this is a nice choice. For more casual gaming, do yourself a favour and look elsewhere.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Relatively tense, longer, middle-to-heavy weight Euro with plenty of moving pieces.  Pretty much all of the mechanics are familiar, and there are a few too many things going on.  This is not a point salad game, though.  Lots of paths to victory, sure, but with a 1-hour explanation/setup time, I'm not sure the fun warranted it.  The bits have some tiny, tiny icons...even if the art is great.  I already traded it away, as the super-dense rulebook won't be conducive to repeat play on the timeline I can offer.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">1st play: This is a really good game. It blends a stock/ownership element with a minor deckbuilding component and there's some hand management thrown in. Teaching it is long, but once you get going the rules make sense and fit together well. Plenty to consider with each move and racing to various elements is rewarded. It seems like there are multiple viable paths to victory, and actions are very tight. Looking forward to my next play.  2nd play: I like the variability of the city tracks, they produce different powers each game, and in this play I took a totally different route. I like the idea of speculating on which companies will be worth the most at the end game and then trying to make those companies stronger. The downside to this game is that it hasn't been that long since my last play and I forgot how some of the mechanics worked. If you strip down some of the extra complexity, the game of stock predicting is fun but is done better in some other stock games. Still enjoyable to play.</comment>

    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Cyprus">Decent Euro. Only Played with 2 which wasn't very interesting. In reality this is a 3-4P game. Has some mix and match mechanisms from other games. Limited player to player conflict. Generally innocuous. I would play it again with no reservations. Hence the rating.  </comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="">This is a medium to heavy euro with some interesting mechanisms that make for a fun challenge for seasoned euro gamers.  The card play feels particularly original.  On the downside,  I did not feel immersed in a theme, but the general use of coffee, bananas, diamonds and cotton as resources to "buy" things (cards and advancement on stock tracks) felt euro-ish and within the general theme of "African ventures" enough.  I like it, though perhaps not love it.</comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">I liked it. For a slam into your friend with fury in your eye, it is a bunch of fun. The miniatures in this game are amazing! Very asymmetrical as it unfolds and this bring replay value as you explore the various power-ups available. Very happy to have this one available for play.  Only take away is the large area needed to display the tiles in the market - bummer on set up as well here. Still, it is my go-to game for dudes on a map that plays in about 45-60 minutes.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Finland">Kemet is a race turning into a tug war later. Player order of prime importance. In the early game you want to be the first to buy the power ups, whereas later you want to be the last to move your armies.  Powering up is great fun, especially if you get the monsters on the board. The tug war part is not so much fun because you are just attacking the weakest army on the board in order to ensure your victory and to secure the victory point you get from winning a battle.   If only the battle system was a bit more exciting and if weak armies would also have a chance, even a small one, would Kemet be a very good game. Now it is just an average multiplayer tactical skirmish. Long term strategy plays a less important role, too. </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">Fun game but would rather play Cyclades (better mechanics and tighter IMO).  Still a keeper though.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">A fun design dudes on the map style game.  The map is really cool design where everyone and everything are equidistant mechanically.  The power ups are fun but doesn't seem super balanced after a few plays.  Still a fun game that is just missing something (maybe the expansion fixes/improves the overall game). </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Brazil">I enjoyed this battle/area control game, it is simple, fast and have lots of possibilities of combos and strategies. The components and art are great, too. The race aspect for the most victory points are not what I appreciate most in games, but in area control games it works fine and you can somehow plan a very great move and make it impossible to revert the situation. The permanent and temporary VPs work fine to not make the game so long in a way that a winning player could be attacked and loose to many VPs. Great game!</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="">Need a few more plays to rate this one definitively.  Early impressions: I really want to love this game! However, for me it feels too Euro, although it does a great job to hide that from people: nice artwork, theme connected to game mechanics, a few of the best-looking miniatures I have ever seen in a game... when played, it's Euro all the way. Not that Euro is a bad thing, but it could have opted for a little more 'feel' instead of 'if you add this number and it's higher than his number you win'. For instance the board looks cool. It's great design creating the spaces as they are: every city at exactly the same distance as everything else... But I don't want that, I want a game to be intuitive, I want to 'see' and 'feel' they are the same distance, not 'accept they are the same distance because the same number of lines run between them'.  Theme (artwork/story/...) 1/2 Gameplay (smooth play/player interaction/strategy&amp;tactics/depth) 5/5 Fun factor (can you afford a smile during play?) 1.5/3  </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Singapore">Feels like a knife fight with four other people in a lift.  It's a pretty simple game that depends on majority on numbers and card play to win. It's a pretty good system that beats dice rolling randomness.  The tiles to boost certain advantage too is a good add on. But I do feel that the 'I bought it you can't have it' idea on the lame side. There will always be certain tiles that are more advantages than the others. It's a matter of circumstances or player interaction, that these circumstances would make other tiles seem just as useful.   In games where no ones knows each other, the game becomes a killer instinct session with no holds barred. Useful tiles will be the first to go to the lucky chap that gets to decide who goes first. The advantage of going last is only apparent importance near the last 2-3 VP snatch moment.  Good fighting game. No story to tell. Just gather the strongest number and do the necessary. Fight a minor battle to get rid of cards and take back the important ones.</comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United Kingdom">Kemet is reminiscent of Nexus Ops in that it is a low complexity conflict game whose scoring system actively encourages aggressive play.  The Sanctuary of All Gods is not quite the focal point that is Nexus' monolith, but it's close.  In Kemet three sets of power tiles aligned to different deities are at the heart of the game.  Of course you'll want the ones that bring mythical monster miniatures, but it's fun to experiment with different combinations to give your forces an edge.  The battle cards ask some quite interesting questions about your appetite to inflict losses and preparedness to take some.  Kemet allows you to leader bash, weakling bash and kingmake.  For my taste only the last of those is a significant demerit.  Overall, it's a fun game.  Production quality is good.  The monsters aren't quite on the monstrous  scale of Cyclades, but they're still handsomely done.  The soldier miniatures are less impressive.  The board is ugly, but functional.  The box is a gaudy delight; it doesn't so much stand out on the shelf as leap off it with a wild cry.   </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United Kingdom">I'm not a huge fan of fighting games but I really enjoyed playing this - there are lots of options and tactical and strategic decisions, combat is quick and simple, and our game was very close indeed.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">Whoa. This game is fun. I love the combat mechanics; I love how overpowered EVERYTHING feels on the tech tree, and I love how different it feels/plays than many other "updated" Risk's. Single biggest flaw: information overload. Here's 48 power tiles with unique abilities and confusing iconography - now play and hope you understand them.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">A very clever game that just didn't hit for me. I acknowledge that the game is really cool, and the prayer tiles appeal to me, but the combat doesn't feel all that rewarding to me. I almost feel like the game is too focused on balancing combat on not enough on tactics. That is probably just me though, as the people I have played with seem to enjoy it a lot more.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Finland">Interesting game, kind of a short Runewars. Nice action &amp; battle mechanics. Just, like many wargames, suffers from ganging up the leader.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">Kemet is a blast. Plays smooth and fast with lots of awesome power tiles and combos to try. Fun to plot out your evil plans.   Updated rating. This is slipping a little because I am beginning to suspect that this needs 4+ to really be its best/balanced. Too bad, since 3 is the player count I usually get to play this with.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United Kingdom">We played last night at Rugby on Board. This is pure Eurotrash, (mostly Trash) with a smattering of civ building. It annoyed me in the same way Cyclades did - a semi-random end game which relies upon everyone knowing who is in a position to win, then stopping them. The problem comes that when you attack somebody to prevent the win, you are making it easier for another player to swoop in and take the victory.   There are also multiple choices available from the start which combined with 5 actions a round, will cripple some AP prone players.   On the plus side, there is a lot of game there for a relatively short play time. It feels a bit like Nexus Ops crossed with Game of Thrones with a few elements of Through the Ages thrown in.   I like that it rewards attacking (you get a point for winning a battle - 8 wins the game).  It is a leader in its class - light but meaty battle-focused area control game playable in under two hours [maybe Chaos in the Old World?]  It has less dodgy combos than Cyclades....  Another 'advantage' over Cyclades is that the rather nicely sculpted minis stay on the board rather than disappear into the ether after a turn.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Thailand">Good game with some sort of balancing.  The payers need to be quite experience to the game to have the truely fun of the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">Fun game that incorporates a bit of action selection, board control, simple attack mechanisms, and great theme.  Would definitely play this before games like Nexus Ops or Chaos in the Old World.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United Kingdom">I like this a lot, but I'm also a miniatures gamer, so this scratches that itch as much as it does the boardgamer in me</comment>

I just couldn't get it to the table enough to make it worth owning.  The only complaint i have is that the rule book is not the greatest.  We would have to consult the rule book more than i like to, and it happened more than once that it didn't give us a clear answer so we had to just vote on how to handle the situation.  this is frustrating.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">A good deduction game, my only complaint is how much it takes to setup and play. Game is great but the execution of the components feels like too much. </comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Denmark">submitted on another forum:  Spillede Alchemists for 2. gang i fredags. Har kun spillet det med min kone, men jeg m&#229; indr&#248;mme at jeg heller ikke er super interesseret i at spille det med flere. Det er et eurospil, med en god omgang deduktion smidt ind i spillet. Og s&#229; er det n&#248;dvendigt med noget elektronik (vi bruger vores iphones, 1 til hver, det fungerer rigtigt fint).  Man bruger sine cubes/workers til at k&#248;be ingredienser, opgraderings/bonus kort, brygge potions, s&#230;lge potions og lave "afhandlinger". Deduktionen kommer ind n&#229;r du har de forskellige ingredienser, og du s&#229; skal regne ud hvilke egenskaber de har. Det er rimelig kl&#248;gtigt, men det g&#248;r ogs&#229; at der skal t&#230;nkes utroligt meget. Vores 2 personers spil har taget omkring 2 timer, men vi tager det s&#229; ogs&#229; meget afslappet. Jeg kunne bare forestille mig at med de folk vi normalt spiller med, s&#229; vil et 4 personers spil nok tage det dobbelte, og det tror jeg ikke spillet kan b&#230;re.   7/10</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">+ The deduction element in this game is unlike anything else that I have in my collection; The components are theme-rich and help to draw you into the game you're playing. - For what it is, this game feels like it goes long each time; If there was a way to shorten it up by 20-30 minutes, it would be a huge hit.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Sweden">As a big fan of deduction and worker placement this one is definitely one I enjoy. It's not for everyone and can probably be a bit on the long end for 4 players. Want to play soon again.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">Very interesting mechanism with a game designed around it. Worth a few plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United Kingdom">Love this game but it makes my head hurt! Worker placement and a logic puzzle rolled into one. Never seems to last long enough! Regular group have enjoyed this one three times.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">Very fun, very interesting, very brain burnery. The app is seamless and works very well. I like the theme, and CGE games always look great. Can't wait to try it again.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Greece">Nice deduction game using a worker placement mechanism with variable player order. Players gather ingredients and mix them in potions using the game application. They can sell potions to various adventurers and use the money to buy artifacts with special abilities. The goal is to deduct the elements of each ingredient and publish your theories. The artwork is great and helps you get into the theme. </comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Poland">A bit chaotic but fun, need more plays for better assessment. So far the game feels interesting but counterintuitive in msny moments. </comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Portugal">First two plays are painful. Hard and fiddly rules on top of an overloaded board. Plus, you need to put on a puzzle-solving mindset. If you go beyond this stage, the game gets surprisingly exciting. The third, fourth and fifth plays are amazing. After that, the game becomes a social sudoku. </comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Belgium">Game with a cell Phone app, so it's quite Original. Although the basic idea is quite easy, working with the app makes it very cool to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">Great deduction game. Highly recommended</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Denmark">I was a bit disappointed with this one after my first play. I didn't like the king making aspect of the "sell a potion" action when you choose which potion to sell. Secondly, I also didn't like the level of randomness that comes from: 1) the artifact cards 2) the degree of luck in the potion making. In my first game I managed out of pure luck to gain knowledge of two theories that could be debunked on the following turn. That won me the game, but felt anticlimactic.  I liked the the czech games edition humor that is also prevalent in this game. The worker placement aspect of the game is decent.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Thailand">Good deduction game. The game is poor for technology dependency but the mechcanic is fairly fun. The color is likely the hugh problem for colorblindness but be able to be accepted by the possitioning of each color is fixed.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">Kind of slow, with the constant rounds of deduction. Interesting use of multiple media channels, for accessible secret data pertinent to the game provided by a device; this allows for a great increase in the ways of working with the secret data -- reading out all or part of it.  Needs pencils. Not pens. </comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Challenging and tense deckbuilding game. Art is good, but has a lot of blood and gore so it may not be for everyone. Wish it came with setup randomisers.</comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">WOW!!!  Nice spin on Legendary!!! The cards are Quasi compatible with the Marvel stuff... its much further apart than Villians is w/ the heros... There is some things that simply do not compute and the rule book just says to ignore it... but I look forward to taking some Marvel Heros though the Alien movies!  Should be neat.  </comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Belgium">It's Alien in your room.  Suspens, horror, strikes and death.  I feel the game is more efficient at 3-4 people (depending of team alchemy).  Rules are very simple, the theme is everywhere... Not perfect but very interesting to play.  I don't understand the size box (a lot of air) but... well... I don't play with it.</comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">[i]Posted: 5/9/16, Rated: 7[/i]  I like being open with you, and telling you when I want to like a game.  In the case of [i]Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game (LE:A)[/i], I'm a big fan of the source material.  Not in the, "I could watch this every day for the rest of my life" sort of way, but in the, "It's been a couple of years since the last viewing and I'm craving me some [i]Alien[/i]" way.  The first movie was hella scary back in the day although it has lost must of its punch: its effects don't hold up well to HDTV's.  The second movie is just pure awesomeness.  The third and fourth movies if they were to exist are terrible.  On top of all that, I've been listening to the folks over at the [url=http://www.dicetower.com/game/146652/legendary-encounters-an-alien-deck-building-game]Dice Tower raving about the game[/url].  When [company=517]Upper Deck[/company] released [i][thing=174570][/thing][/i] and it could be combined with [i]LE:A[/i], I was finally in for a copy.  Alien vs. Predator is a concept that was best done in the original Dark Horse comic books, yielded two execrable films, and some fun video games.  I'm rambling at this point.  Let's get to the game.  [i]LE:A[/i] is the first cooperative deck-building game I've played.  Right there, that's interesting.  This isn't just "my engine is better than yours."  It's "we're working together to beat these baddies."  From helping each other buy better cards (the "Sergeant" card), to killing facehuggers before they turn into chestbursters inside of your teammates, to helping them kill bosses, this really feels like a team experience.  The "Coordinate" action is the source of this synergy, and I really like it.  [i]LE:A[/i] does a great job of translating the menace and the fear of the movies into a board game.  Those alien cards keep flowing into the Complex, and you won't know what's coming unless you spend combat points to "scan" that room, or until it shows up in the Combat Zone.  It's easy to keep those places separate because the game includes a playmat -- finally!  It makes managing the experience a breeze.  The artwork on the cards aren't movie stills, but rather comic-like pictures of scenes in the movies.  And here is my first gripe: some of the cards do a great job of depicting Ripley or Captain Dallas, while others are barely recognizable.  The pictures of Corporal Hicks and Private Hudson do not look anything like Michael Biehn or Bill Paxton.  Since the movies were sci-fi horror films, some of the artwork is graphically violent.  Also, there could have been a greater variety of artwork used.  All "Facehugger" cards use the exact same graphic -- even the ones that go into the Strike Deck (how you determine damage taken from the aliens) or the Drone Deck (extra baddies that are shuffled in with the cards for each objective).  I initially thought I was missing a card because I didn't know what to expect.  That leads me to the biggest gripe I have with this game: sorting it all out.  I had heard how onerous sorting was, but I didn't believe it until I tried it on my own.  [b]The instructions don't tell you how.[/b]  They leave it up to you to realize that there are deck identifiers on the bottom of each card written in a smaller, faint font.  If you're thinking about buying this game, then be sure to print out [filepage=107161]this card list[/filepage] by [user=gwarjuice]gwarjuice[/user].  It's a tremendous help to organizing the game.  Upper Deck should have included this information in the instruction booklet.  [i]Legendary Encounters: Alien[/i] delivers a tense, highly thematic experience.  Its tension and gruesome nature means I won't be playing this game all the time.  I rather expect a few weeks or months will pass, and then I'll be craving me some [i]Alien.[/i]</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="">One of my favourite worker-placement games so far. Interesting mechanics which blend well enough flavourfully. There was a sense of grandeur managing my nation, and every nation felt unique thanks to their different special powers.  It's replayable; flows surprisingly well.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Wales">Very clever civilisation game, with familiar mechanics but lots of nice new twists. Well-paced and perfectly balanced. It's all very intuitive, and the components are nice (even if some of the artwork is a little amateurish). It feels like a meatier St Petersburg, and that's not a bad thing at all! Great strategy game.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Not a good game for my group - too long and too bland.  Solo play wasn't good enough to keep for my own play.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">+ The different nations you can start as feel different enough to really add to the replayability; Cool cards to buy and use really have you weighing tough options on each and every turn. - Military can feel a bit binary, but I like that choosing no military is a viable option.   Why it's previously-owned: The drafting/buying cards from the tableau just didn't feel right to me.  Just the fact that Abraham Lincoln can be purchased by the Chinese is one odd moment that pushed this into the I-like-it-but-I'll-probably-always-choose-another-game category. This got traded for a bunch of Star Wars LCG stuff.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Spain">Baja de 7.5 a 7.3, mala experiencia sacando mepples desde el principio, pesan como una losa! Adem&#225;s ir a militar parece casi obligatorio.</comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Through The Ages redux.  The similarities are too plentiful to be ignored.  In fact, the overall gameplay and experience feels very much the same.  Granted, there are many differences (especially military, wars &amp; TtA's culture track), but I would rather play TtA.  Nations is a solid civ game.  The cards drive the game.  Limited manpower.  A nice twist with different starts via the B-sides of the player mats.  And you don't see all of the cards in any age, not even close, meaning different games can and will have wildly different skews in card distribution.  Also, the events push-pull on EVERYTHING, which can be good, bad or ridiculously painful.  VP gain is *VERY* incremental.  I want to say Nations is a nice, faster, lighter take on Through The Ages.  Yes, I *want* to say that but I can't.  Because it isn't.  It doesn't play much faster.  It's not that much lighter.  And the warfare in Nations is actually *MORE* brutal than with TtA.  I'll play Nations at times, I suppose, but I'll probably be wondering why I'm not playing Through The Ages instead.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Brazil">Good game, I simply enjoyed playing this game very much, a lot of things to do, a lot of different aproaches and everything seems very balanced, the game plays very smooth.

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Initial rating.  Was solid, and a lot shorter than through the ages, but felt easier/less deep.  I like it.  Military feels much better balanced than in TTA. </comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="New Zealand">Not nearly as good as Through the Ages but still fun. Reminiscent of In The Year Of The Dragon. </comment>

My one criticism, which I'm not even sure how strongly I feel about, is that it may get to feel a bit 'samey' over 8 rounds.</comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="England">Oh god not *another* civilisation game. But wait! What's this? Not too long and plenty interesting strategy choices? Worth another go sometime!</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Spain">Gran juego de civilizaciones, con mec&#225;nicas de eurogame, eso si. Tengo que probarlo m&#225;s antes de dar un veredicto definitivo, pero por el momento me ha gustado.  Se parece al TTA en las cosas buenas y es mucho m&#225;s &#225;gil porque no tienes que esperar a que los otros jugadores acaben su turno antes de hacer t&#250; el tuyo. Se van alternando las acciones y eso lo hace mucho m&#225;s din&#225;mico.  Escala bien, te mantiene siempre interesado en la partida y rezuma civilizaciones aunque no es un tem&#225;tico ni mucho menos.  La variedad de cartas, y que no se jueguen siempre todas, hace que las partidas sean siempre diferentes. Tambi&#233;n ayuda a esto los eventos que van apareciendo que tb. son diferentes siempre y de dureza muy variable.  Lo peor de todo es la caja, que es enorme para lo que contiene. Demasiado aire.  Veremos como va evolucionando, pq superar a TTA no es cosa f&#225;cil. Puede que este Nations, al ser tan pulido y tan redondo canse un poco a la larga, mientras que TTA con sus impurezas siempre es un valor seguro. Es una impresi&#243;n que me ha dado. El TTA no es perfecto, pero tiene algo que hace que sea muy dif&#237;cil de quemar. No s&#233; si en este caso ocurrir&#225; lo mismo.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Netherlands">Initial rating after playing twice. Very well put together game, with excruciating decisions. Early turns in a new round take forever due to far too many choices. Turns after that speed up a lot, so the game doesn't feel like too much of a slog, but it sure takes a looong time; more than I'm generally fond of. Cards in the basic game feel very similar, with just numbers swapped about - I hope the advanced cards will mix it up a bit.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="England">Had I not played Through the Ages, then I would have found much to admire about this game.  As it is it simplifies some aspects of TTA, handles the war very nicely, introducing a target set by the player declaring war, which can be mitigated if you declare war yourself by setting it at your own strength level.  Our first game suffered from very few early blue cards appearing, restricting possibilities of employing more meeples.  I guess our expectations were set by TTA, whereas there are some minor variations from TTA in Nations (including the fact that only of a selection of the cards will be used, adding to the replayability but also some 'lumpyness').  There lies my concern with this game.  I cannot recall playing a published game which so closely resembles another published game.  Nations is good but it is not TTA, which was a ground breaker and I think superior.  Plagurism is a work that springs to mind.  I could see no reference to TTA as a source/inspiration in the rule book which I think is out of order.  I do however note that TTA's designer Vlaada Chv&#225;til is mentioned in the credits.  So I assume there must have been some tacit approval of its publication from VC, or maybe this just reflects some tension between CGE and CBG?  As a foot note I should add that whilst four of the five players got some satisfaction from the game, the fifth gave up in frustration, tipped his board over and left.  First time that has happened to me in many year's of gaming.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Rating based on a single play.  Way more luck than TtA, but has good ideas. I think you'd need to play with a variant where at least 2 of each card type (maybe only 1 war or yellow) showed up each turn, to prevent someone from getting hosed.  Rating -- Suggest (partially due to novelty).</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Canada">So much better than Memoir '44 and Battlelore.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="">After not being too enthused by C&amp;C for all these years, I finally get it, I realized I don't enjoy complex war-games as much as I used to and with much less time on my hands these days complex games rarely if ever get to the table. So C&amp;C fills a niche slot - a low complexity , streamlined and enjoyable light war-game. </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">Already I must agree that this is the best C&amp;C game yet (though I've yet to try Napoleonics). With the very sober rules system small differences in units stats play out in vastly different ways, and it's striking different they feel in practice. For example, auxiliary light infantry and basic light infantry at first glance seem very similar, but after a couple turns you'll notice that auxiliary act as light shock infantry while basic light infantry are simply ranged harassers.  The game is still a bit heavy on the dice, and I think a combat results table would bring the game to a new level. Still, for a breezy war game (a rare creature) this is a treat.</comment>

    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Netherlands">Played a few times but I prefer Memoir. This one seems to have more strategy (tactic?) inside, but this is one of the reasons I prefer the lighter Memoir. Also, I prefer miniatures rather than wooden cubes. I consider the colouring system and the unit types, similar to Battlelore, badly designed. I prefer the clearer and more logical "soldier, tank, artillery" approach of Memoir than the nonintuitive colour based unit types. </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">Such a great, fun system</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">This is a fun game with lots of units, lots of good, quick planning and good ol' fighting. Set up takes a while, but other than than it is a good game</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Portugal">Have a lot of fun playing CC Ancients some years ago (2007-2008).  I remember having played all scenarios and then have changed sides with my opponent. Currently there are games with more "meat" and we no longer waste time with CC Ancients. The setup time was truly unbearable !! I just have th CC Ancients base and don&#180;t care with all endless expansions (What a waste of wood!!) It's nice to have it around if it appears some euro player to teach her/him something Epic and bloodier :)  </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Spain">Rating 6.5  I like the system, but this game didn't catch on me...  Lately, i'm thinking in giving it another try...  OWNED BY: Julio, Nino</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Singapore">A wargame that is played within a very reasonable amount of time and has easy to understand rules. Although the card draw and dice rolling luck factor might detract for very hardcore wargamers. Also, the set up can be quite long but that is easily solved by using numerous cardboard pieces or dice for hit points instead of individual blocks.  In conclusion, It is still strategic, tactical and the time factor will see it hit the table a lot. </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">A very fun game to play.  A lot of tough choices to make which is great.  A unit with one piece left fight at full strength seems a bit odd coming from chit-heavy games.  I WANT to play heavier games, but this plays so fast and is fun that its appeal the cannot be denied... when i have 2 hours or less to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">A fun, light system, and a great way to introduce the uninitiated to wargaming. That said, the more you play, the more you discover C&amp;C:A has far more strategic depth than simply moving up your line, crashing into your opponent, and throwing some dice. It&#8217;s not a game I&#8217;d want to play for entire night all too often, but when I&#8217;m short on time, or need a gap-filler, it&#8217;s great to know a game this fun with true challenges can be played in less than an hour. If you can find enough of the expansions to fill out the necessary blocks, the Epic games are a blast. </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United Kingdom">Excellent game! Takes the Command &amp; Colors system that extra step.Traded away June 2006. Ultimately too light for my tastes - exchanged for RRR! Initially rated 8.  </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Australia">Ultimately, I'd like to own a block wargame. I enjoy the tactile aspect and particularly like when the block faces are hidden from an opponent, to represent the Fog Of War.   C+C:A is a sound game. Sound isn't good enough in my small collection. C+C:A isn't enough of a departure from Chess - likely the FIRST game in my collection. The hand management and unit variation features are pleasant, but not failed to add the necessary drama I might enjoy to shift the dynamic enough from the serious, high-stakes consequences of decisions in Chess to the more fun, front-loaded gambling of conflict-heavy games like Flash Duel or Cry Havoc. I would even look to Claustrophobia before this.  </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="">In principle, I think it's better designed, cleaner, more strategic than Memoir.  My wife (who wiped the floor with me) hates the spreadsheet of unit range/CC/move/evade/etc., and misses Terrain.  Feels too much like chess to her, so won't get played much.  Ah, well.  Rating is more "for us" (ok, then it's maybe a 6, 7 tops) than actual evaluation of the game quality.  Note:  compared to BattleLore, the command cards are much more effective, and less frustrating, and the "keep your men together" is more subtle and interesting.</comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">A game most people can get behind. I've never really had trouble explaining the game, as it is very straight-forward and simple to understand and have fun with. The theming is great - the effects most things have make a lot of sense when you're placing them in your city. My main issue with this game is that I think it is ugly. Flat-out ugly. The art is lifeless and drab enough to make me struggle to want to play the game. A fresh coat of paint would go sooooo far with this game.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">3 plays / 2,3 players  LIKE: combos everywhere. city building is fun and the tiles create a narrative. DISLIKE: very fiddly with a lot of moving parts. time spent checking to see what tile effects other tiles. game may be a touch too long. OVERALL: fun game, not too difficult to play. the game arc builds nicely with the C-level tiles.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="Finland">Combine the combos is the name of the game. I find buying and laying the tiles rather enjoyable. Every turn you are trying to create the best combos while gathering momentum for your income and victory point generation so that you do not run out of steam too early. Furthermore, the common and secret goals give you one more thing to ponder.  Some negatives can be found as well. My primary whine is about the tiles that give you bonuses for every tile of certain type in the game. It is just so hard to keep track of what everyone else has. Most of the time you also forget to take the benefit when other players add tiles into their boroughs. Ok, this introduces interaction into the game but at the cost of playability. Other issues I have with the art which is rather uninspiring. However, this is in the eye of the beholder.  The similarities with Castles of Mad King Ludwig are quite obvious. Personally, I prefer the Castle building due to its art and the more limited cascade of things triggered when you place the tiles.  </comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Pleasant tile city-building game.  Good little puzzles each turn.  A little repetitive.  Seems to go on just long enough.  I love the balance between the Income and Reputation tracks, but it can be devastating if your income drops too low, as there is no catch-up mechanism.  Good production value, but the font for +1 and -1 has the + and - way too small...damn near need a magnifying glass to play!</comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Finland">I'm amazed how well the athmosphere of WW1 has been translated into a boardgame. From what I've read, WW1 was very static, yet the balance was a very delicate one. So in this part the designers have had an enormous success with PoG.   When it comes to the gameplay itself, my initial game was fun and I enjoyed it, despite losing. However, I do not know how much fun it would be to live through those events over and over again when a single game can take up to 10 hours... I guess it will take quite a long time to find out because the chances to invest a whole day into a single game are very scarce.</comment>

It is difficult to judge how well you are doing - a bit like Britannia. You will probably need a few plays to get a feeling for what is a lead and what is a close game.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Spain">Buen juego. Uno de los padres de todos los CDG que han surgido despu&#233;s. Tenso y entretenido, aunque me parece mucho m&#225;s complejo jugando con las Potencias Centrales que desde luego no llegan a todo con los ej&#233;rcitos que gestionan. Gran reto en el control del timing de las diferentes fases de guerra y la entrada de neutrales. Una de las partes m&#225;s interesantes a mi gusto.  Su peor parte, sin duda, es lo cuidadoso que hay que ser con el tema del suministro. En especial con las Potencias Centrales debido al orden de turno y a la baja densidad de counters en algunos sectores (no tienen para todo). Un descuido puntual, a final del turno, implica la p&#233;rdida definitiva del ej&#233;rcito (o ej&#233;rcitos) y pr&#225;cticamente el final de la partida. Esto da lugar a una guerra mucho m&#225;s m&#243;vil que la que aconteci&#243; hist&#243;ricamente, con alguna situaci&#243;n un poco irreal. Este tema me pareci&#243; mucho mejor implementado en el WWII: BtB (del mismo autor y muy similar en sus mec&#225;nicas) ya que la mec&#225;nica del suministro es menos implacable. Y en cualquier caso, los embolsamientos son en este caso un acercamiento m&#225;s hist&#243;rico por el conflicto que trata (una guerra m&#225;s m&#243;vil, sin duda).  Me gusta el juego, pero el tema del suministro me parece demoledor y bastante anticlim&#225;tico porque al menos al principio much&#237;simas partidas terminan por embolsamientos y eliminaci&#243;n, lo cu&#225;l a mi particularmente no me resulta especialmente divertido (da igual si gano o pierdo con ello).</comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">The western front is not always so quiet.  There are few games that capture a particular feel as well as PoG.  In the wave upon wave of fruitless attacks and the back and forth lines from advances and retreats, this game does a remarkable job capturing the hopelessness of the First World War.  The game's components are not great (a hard-mounted board and larger chits would be nicer and give the game a bit of a face-lift), but that should not deter the serious history fan from diving into this game.  The biggest detraction of the game is the play time.  Overall a solid war game that is playable but long, very long.  [GTI: TPSD]</comment>

Not only are the exceptions a little too much, the regular rules just can't seem to stay in my memory.

It was surprising how easy it was to pick up and learn, and then surprising how much work it took to really understand and master it. By that time, the card game had outworn its welcome, and the digital version took hold. The rating is for the overall game, but I'd have to rank the actual card game lower, because it's a card game. Also, because of the way authority is tracked (through cards). This was a great game that should have just been a digital game from the get go.</comment>

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">After a couple of plays (Railroad Tycoon), I must say that it's an improvement over Age of Steam (AOS).   Things I like:  * It's faster playing (vs. AOS) with games ending so quickly that it can catch you off guard.The railroad operation cards are a very nice touch adding randomness to the game and lots of tactical goals to take advantage of. More ways to victory versus the AOS system.  * Building a network is more organic and realistic in this game with much, much less of the tricky, spiral track building found in a successful AOS victory.   * While the economics aren't painful like AOS, there's a subtle importance of being thrifty and wise with expenditures.   * Auctions are not quite the ugly, thrashing battles of AOS but are generally more dignified with an occasional battle very early in the game over geographic position or over a very important railroad card.  Now things I don't like:  * Okay let me get it out - the game board is RIDICULOUS in its size. It's simply not designed with the game players in mind. It's more like a model railroader decided to create a map and pieces. The map should be 30-40% smaller for true competitive play and tournament play. Important railroad operation cards can be a long distance from 1 or more players. Some people talk about their place at the table actually determining where they will build because it's easier to see what's in front of you and they're lazy. I understand that point.   * Also, I don't like the way the victory point track was created. It's very difficult to keep the locos where they should be on the track and the printing of VP's and income is just too small. The older I get, the more this last point is important.  * The rules are vague in a couple of important places and a set of revised rules or official FAQ is something truly needed.  * Three player game balance is very tricky. Two players is straight forward and four players is probably the sweet spot. Five and Six player games probably make for a longer more unruly game but that wouldn't effect play balance. It might have been nice if specific scenarios had been created for 2 and 3 player games (beyond initial cube distribution and number of empty city markers). Scenarios that take out geographic portions of the board (along with certain cards) and maybe give players a specific Tycoon card as a goal.  Overall, I like the game as railroad games go. Is it my favorite? Not sure. I really, really like Ticket to Ride/Marklin Edition. But more RRT plays may change my mind as to my favorite... or not.</comment>

Now that Steam is out, I have a game with the parts I like about RRT without the parts I found questionable. RRT is still a very fun game, but the length, size and wonkiness (particularly with USA board) makes it somewhat less attractive to play.   Despite the fact that the board is too big, the board warps and some colours are hard to distinguish, this is a VERY fun game which is VERY pretty to look at. Mechanics are simple without being simplistic. This is a great game to use when trying to lead someone beyond "gateway" games such as Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne because it's quite straighforward yet there is depth there.</comment>

Every game creates a memorable narrative and it feels almost like I'm watching a movie, only I'm an active participant in it.  The card-driven aspect is new to me, but I really like it; it seems to be a very innovative and cool way to take care of die rolls, random events, the confusion that happens in the midst of battle, and the advancement of time, all together.  I even have a great time playing this solo, just imagining in my head how the battle is playing out.  Seems to take me a long time to do much in the game, though.</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">1 play / 4 players  LIKE: Great interaction when jockeying for an artist and then have someone else help build them up. The bump out action was an interesting mechanism because players have open information, allowing players to plan ahead a little to prevent others from taking advantage of free actions. I enjoyed how the visitor meeples worked. Unique theme.  DISLIKE: The first turn felt a little scripted. Simple rules, but complicated edge cases that are difficult to remember. The board looks busy at first.  OVERALL: I had my doubts, but it's an impressive, solid game. It seems intimidating at first, but it simplifies after a few rounds. I would play this again, plenty of strategies to try. If this plays well with 3 players, rating will go up.</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Canada">Theme doesn't really come through with this one and feels VERY mechanical. There's a lot going - one thing requires another which requires another and so on which makes it tricky to figure out where in that loop to start from. Interesting game that works very well but is quite dry.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">Mechanically speaking, this is a worker placement game that may seem a bit dull on the surface. That's because players only have one worker in the game and there are only four worker-placement spots. Thus, if a player pawn hasn't been moved/kicked... a player only has a choice of 3-spots to go to. Sounds boring... right?   Well the thing is, the limited choices help amplify the kickback mechanic, which is what really makes this game shine. See, if a player kicks your pawn (or an assistant) the kicked-player will then have the option to do a partial or full action. Thus, the entire mechanic encourages players to focus on each other and place their pawn/assistance in spots where they will get kicked off. But, as one can expect from a Vital Lacerda design, it's not that easy. That's because to utilize a full-action, players must go back on a track, which controls three different attributes (money, influence, and fame). Thus, taking advantage of a kickback action may have significant ramifications such as not having enough money, not having enough fame to manipulate an artist's reputation, and not being able to do another kickback actions. Therefore, manipulating this tract to capitalize on as many extra actions as possible is a huge aspect of this game... but it isn't an easy one and it isn't one that can be played with a solitaire mindset.  Overall, this isn't your typical euro. Combined with the shared incentivization aspect, the game feels much more interactive and engaging than many worker-placement games. Yet, it is still firmly within that "euro" stereotype with its low-luck, puzzly, and point-salady nature.   Mechanically speaking, this is a heavy euro... but it has outstanding iconography and player aids, which makes teaching/learning/playing the game much easier. Seriously, I can't understate how wonderful the components are. Everything is produced to a very high level but not to the point where it becomes distracting or a hindrance to understanding the mechanics. This game simply pushes the envelope in both component and game quality.  With more plays, I can see my rating increasing. Wonderful game!</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Belgium">Score na eerste speling met Ilse. Worker placement met &#233;&#233;n worker, waarbij je artiesten aantrekt, werken koopt en verkoopt, ondertussen hun reputatie laat groeien (en dus de werken duurder maakt), en ook je assisten wat aan promotie laat doen. Ik had het spel iets mooier verwacht (voor die prijs, kost zowat 70 eur), en iets intu&#239;tiever.  (Krijgt wel een score van meer dan 4/5 qua heaviness) Ik wil het wel nog enkele keren spelen vooraleer een definitief oordeel te vellen, maar kopen doe ik het alvast niet.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="England">First play: Long and fiddly set up taking c30 minutes with another 30 to explain the rules. The game comes with a very useful player aid which is essential to review and remember the options. A deep and brain burning game where the first play must be written off to grasp where the end game points come from. Overlapping mechanisms give multiple routes to resources and end game points. Will probably grow with further plays.</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States"> This is an interesting mix of mechanics that is NEARLY too much.   I think it's right at the very edge of my tolerance as far as complexity goes.   Whereas Vinhhos and Kanban seem to go over that line for me, this one is just a little bit more accessible.  Still, it's a dense game and teaching it / setting it up seems to be a bit of an ordeal.   It's not a game I would own or ever suggest playing, but I did enjoy it.  I do really like the theme and the artwork.   The board I thought was very attractive and distinct, and the theme was also unique and things made thematic sense for the mostpart.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">A fun combination of ameritrash dice combat and euro-style area control.  I have concerns about balance between the factions, but I think that with experienced players the balance is less of an issue.  </comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Unbalanced and asymmetrical, yet not unbalanced and asymmetrical. An odd game in that sense. Needs more time on the table, but it does appear to have legs.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">I hope that I would enjoy it, but was very pleased and a little surprise at how fun the game is. The complexity level is just right for me, the asymmetric powers of the gods are very interesting, and the replayability seems quite high. I hope to get many more plays out of this title!</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Romania">It is an area control/influence game based in the Warhammer universe. You control one of four faction and compete to fulfill different objectives. Every turn you corrupt the landscape, dominating its inhabitants, and battle with the depraved followers of rival gods. Each god has a unique deck of gifts and abilities, and can upgrade their followers into deadly foes. Summon forth living manifestations of Chaos, debased and hidden cultists, and the horrifying greater daemons - beings capable of destroying near everything in their path. You have multiple ways of winning the. The downside however is that it plays well only with four players, otherwise it becomes unbalanced. </comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Germany">I love the Warhamemr Fantasy setting. Playing the chaos faction is a nice twist. All four deities require a unique strategy. Good game...if you can handle the theme.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Canada">Excellent RPG style game. Played with 4 players, everyone had a different playing experience - very enjoyable overall. We did have an long discussion about the end game conditions, and decided that Check the End Game sub-phase is the only time where we evaluate whether the game is over or not. We did discuss this point extensively, however, since the "anytime" word in the rulebook threw us off.   If it comes down to a 4 player game to play, I think it'll come to this one (due to rarity of 4 player game nights). If we have our usual 5+ players, I think we'll be looking at Small World (for a shorter game when we want to play multiple games in one day) or Shogun (for those marathon, one game days).

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">This game seems like risk with better artwork, and a few extra rules. Combat is a drag and nothing more than a dice roll with barely any way to modify the outcome.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Variable player powers and multiple paths to victory are enjoyable.  I also like that it is semi-cooperative.  Better knowledge of the nuances of how the Gods interact with each other would enhance enjoyment.</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">3-5(4,5)  It's solid. Nice area control mechanics and very interesting player powers and scoring objectives. Issues for me are that, yes, Khorne can be a bit intimidating, but his play is sort of boringly straight-forward not much thinking going on. Additionally, the other players can often just sort of try to claim their nooks (with their relevant tokens and such) and the only interaction is avoiding Khorne. I'm certain, though, that after some plays it will become obvious that you'll need to start crippling other (non-Khorne) players. As it was, I've played Khorne and thought it was frustratingly boring because it was pretty obvious what I needed to do to win and subsequently players made the "obvious" moves of going out of their way to give me nothing to attack. Also, it is important to know all the decks and I can see how some would prefer having a community action deck to pull from (for balance reasons).</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United States">Ticket to Ride:  Europe is an above-average strategy game.  There's a lot of planning and you really have to try to figure out what your opponents are doing, otherwise, they might take valuable tracks before you can.    There's a fairly good skill element to this game, but if I have a complaint, it's that there is a significant luck element in which routes you draw at the beginning of the game.  It can be difficult to win with some of the Western European routes, and there's one high-scoring route between two cities that vastly superior to all others.  In this sense, the game ends up being a bit like Risk in that there are really only maybe 3-4 viable winning strategies against good players.  All the same, it's still a fun game with a lot of strategy.  I think somewhere around a "7" is probably an appropriate rating.  </comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United States">Adds some nice new twists to Ticket to Ride.  Plays great with two players if one adds train cars to each player, otherwise it ends just when it is starting to get interesting. </comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United States">Rating TTR series as a whole.  Even though this series jumped the shark back in 2010 (seriously, who plays Ticket to Ride so much that they need 18 different maps to play it on??), some of the earlier entries in the series are great.  Ticket to Ride is normally a go to game for newbies who have never tried a Euro style board game before.    The European edition is great for 4 to 5 players.  While there is still stress associated with claiming routes, the addition of the stations make losing a key route less game-breaking.  Over numerous plays, we have discovered that the player who draws the "Brest-Petrograd" long route at the beginning of the game seems to win a disproportionate share of the time.  </comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="Canada">A beautiful game, pretty lightweight, enjoyable to play with non-gamers and gamers (although, if I've got some gamers togehter I'd rather pull out something meatier). Doesn't feel substantially different from the original despite the changes (if I had to pick, I'd say that I like this one a little bit more). Update 2005 05 14: I still slightly prefer this version to the original, but I wish I had bought the original. Why? Because there are just enough fiddly rules here, combined with a less accessible/ familiar map, to alienate the casual players this is aimed at. In the end, I wanted a game to pull out with the family, etc, so simpler would have been better. If I want a more strategic game, I'll choose an entirely different game.</comment>

DISLIKE: Cutthroat and sometimes brutal, but not an unforgiving game. Poor planning can lead to a quick loss.   OVERALL: I lost terribly by getting blocked and not having a backup plan. That aside, the game is tense and thoughtful. Plays relatively quick (2-3h?) for an involved train game. Something to play occasionally, but not an everyday game. </comment>

When it is released I'm sure the die hard fans will hate it but don't listen to them, all the fun bits are here without all the cruft. I'm not a wallace fan but this was genuinely *fun*. The backwards (and *forwards* for 2nd ed fans) compatibility is a great concession and for once I might choose AoS over RRT if offered the choice. Now please please please hire an artist to do some prettier maps &amp; markers!</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United Kingdom">Good combination of economic mechanisms and map-based route building.

Drawback - the obvious good and bad roles choices at the beginning and the end of the game. </comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="">First Review February 2012:  Steam is probably the best "train game" that I have ever played, though in truth, I am not that big a fan of "train games." As such, my best "train game" merits a maximum rating of...8.  Second Review May 2012:  I find that I prefer Railroad Tycoon to Steam because it leavens the dominant, overbearing concern with delivering cubes to "get those victory points" with some additional, interesting (dare I say fun?) ways to earn victory points in other ways, namely, linking cities and satisfying secret goals (ala Ticket To Ride), delivery bonuses, and hotels.  This ever so slight leavening of the one dimensional "must deliver cubes" approach I think improves the gaming experience.  In particular, RR Tycoon provides evident, additional paths to victory, and that is almost always a good thing in a game. So...Steam drops to a 7, and RR Tycoon earns the 8.</comment>

There are a few attack cards, but generally give players a choice.  OVERALL: A delightful game that plays smooth and within a good time frame (except 6 players can be long). The cards seem to be powerful when timed properly, but this is what makes the game interesting. Similar to Lords of Waterdeep.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">Beautifully-presented, elegantly-designed game.  I liked seeing the lifecycle presented here: drawing vine cards -&gt; planting them -&gt; harvesting grapes -&gt; crushing them into wine -&gt; selling bottles...it felt very authentic.  I'm just a little bothered by the cards.  At least half of them are worthless, depending on where you are in the game...which makes the drawing and playing of cards very tedious.  Still pretty decent, though.  Don't know yet if it will fire [b]Grand Cru[/b].</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">An excellent worker placement game.  My issue with the game is that card draws can have a [b]strong[/b] effect on your success.  More good draws than bad and you will have a very good chance at winning.  More bad draws than good and you will have a lot to overcome.  It's certainly not guaranteed, but since there is a broad range of card strengths (and some of them are situational) this can have a significant impact.  It kind of hits doubly so since there are a variety of visitor cards and order cards.  I'd be happier with the game if this disparity were less determinative.  EDIT (7/18/16):  The above rating and description are for the base game.  As in base base.  As in the base game that no longer exists because Stonemaier wrapped three small expansions into it and now sells it as the Essential Edition.  ...but get Tuscany and use those modules, okay?</comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="">A lot of games are about creaming your opponents in business, on a map, or whatever.  Viticulture is more like a race to get your business up and running. And then, once it has a steady customer or two, and a few regularly producing fields, the game ends.  You get a lot of the basic Euro-style mechanisms, but since you're not really competing with anyone, you get to go through the process of business-making more as a labor of love than as a competition. Yes, you want to get through the goalpost faster than the others, but by the time that happens, everyone's basically gotten their business functional as well, just not quite as profitable off the bat. So they still feel like the succeeded.  It's a very friendly and good feel game, while giving you some fun choices.  The cons of the game, however, are that:  1) No one can remember how to plant vines, create grapes, and turn them into wine. You just can't emphasize how much they need to pay attention when you go through it, you're going to have to go through it all again, individually, for each player, as they get to that step for the first time. Everything else in the game is very straightforward. You plonk a dude down and grab something. But the wine production pipeline - which is barely really a mechanism of the game, just a sequence of events that largely happens on its own according to some rules - is impossible for anyone to remember, until they've done it once.  2) The game advertises itself as being for 6 players. I've played 4 players once and...never again. Maybe if you had some expert players, none with AP, you could fit 6 in there. But I'd really suggest sticking with 2-3. And so it really seems like a waste of space to have that third bubble on every location.  3) If you get the Tuscany expansion, everything on the board is designed to give you stuff (particularly cards). It's sort of a chore to keep track of all the stuff you should be getting between each season, plus all the things you get from your actual actions. It ends up handing you so much stuff that if they added 'play a card' to the rooster track, you could basically play the whole game without ever placing any meeples, just deciding what time of the day to get up at. You would end up getting almost as much stuff that way as playing the original game, regular. And while that aspect probably appeals to the sort of person that likes Facebook games, which are just constantly trying to push items and coins and whatnot onto you, to appeal to our instinct to desire plenty; it's not like the base game is all that tight, so that it needed an easy mode. It was already a fun, easy, multiplayer solitaire building game. Having all four seasons is good, thematically. It definitely seemed like an obvious oversight in the original game. But I wish they'd left the rooster track alone and not put the star map on one side of the board.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">A bit slow, but the theme is very interesting.  It is a good worker placement game, but I think that until I get the expansion it will remain a later pick among my games.</comment>

The random distribution of the event cards and the skewed choosing of turn order phase is improved upon with the expansion.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United Kingdom">Occupies the space between Stone Age and Agricola. Fairly simple and easy to grasp, streamlined play, but with meaty decisions and multiple paths to victory. Much of the game revolves around drawing cards and it feels like a little too much luck (this comes from someone who thinks the amount of luck in Stone Age and Agricola is just right). The theme really comes through in the game, it doesn't feel like "points salad."   Elements of Tuscany improve the game so much that it makes the base game feel like a rough draft. The upcoming Essential Edition seems to fix this, although I think leaving out the enhanced board was a mistake. The new board changes the game drastically, and I think few people would ever want to go back to the old board. Again, it feels like the new board is the "revised, final" version of the game. </comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">Includes: Tuscany, Moor Visitors  As with most worker placement games it is more frustrating at a higher player count. </comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">This was a interesting tight game. Would enjoy playing this a few more times.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">A very "ok" game.  I like it, but I prefer worker placement games that "evolve", games like Agricola or Le Havre that add different actions as the game matures.  The good:  - Beautifully crafted and awesome looking.  - Many Paths to victory.  - The designer is actively involved in the community and makes a real effort to improve the game even after release where possible (the Grande Worker, for example, makes the 2 player version tons more fun)  - A lot of worker placement games make more workers always better, here that's not necessarily the case since there is scarcity in action, it's more of a balancing act and not always automatically better. The flip side of that is getting higher priority feels too important.  - Awesome thematically (if that's something you care about)  Could be good or bad depending on what you like:  - Game is strangely balanced (number of player wise) based  on the way action spaces are allocated (getting another action space at 3 and 5 players), meaning the game is tons better with certain numbers of players if you like looseness of actions (3 and 5 players) and tons better with different numbers of players if you like tight action and lots of action contention (4 and 6 players)  - Because of how so many actions build on others (harvesting leads to crushing which leads to placing orders) blocking players out of moves can be particularly punishing because you can't just move on to the next step in the chain, this can push your plans back years and often the back up alternative actions aren't just weaker they're often feel just plain bad (making the game less fun).  - Making the most kick ass vineyard isn't actually the best thing to do and probably won't get you a win.  - Little to no use for Lira end game.  The bad:  - Feels (to me) like it ends abruptly and suddenly, also a little early.  - Randomness of the visitor cards (feel unbalanced and too luck based)  - Too few cards (cycle through the decks too often in bigger games)</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="England">Worker placement in two phases, Spring summer set up and grow your vineyard, Autumn/Winter harvest and sell.  Viticulture was engaging.  The addition of the super meeple allowed access to all actions which was apparently missing in the earlier version.  As the game moved on, so did seemingly the importance of the Autumn/Winter actions.  Some luck in cards drawn.  But sufficient planning opportunities to be engaging.  </comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">Big meaty game.   I need more plays to get a better feel.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Australia">Excellent components and theme. I initially thought the game looked promising with lots of different options of what to build, harvest and do each turn. However as the cards you draw are so variable, it inevitably leads you down the path of having to get irrigation and the large cellar. Then it's everyone competing for most of the same spaces at around the same time. The cards that let you discard to draw more help, however an action space or two with this similar function would be even better.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">There is a lot of hidden I formation in this game, making scoring by your opponents unpredictable and thus difficult to interfere with. Your own scoring is somewhat random as it requires the draw of cards. Nonetheless there is certainly room for skill. I did not like the use of the large worker as it weakened blocking actions. I think the better more cutthroat game is without it, so I would want the original version.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">It seems to have some balance problems. Cards vary a lot in usefulness. Being locked out of something early, like building a structure, can make it hard to catch up. Edit: Grande worker fixes second problem.</comment>

    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">A co-op that plays fast and furious. I love all the miniatures and obviously the overall production quality is outstanding. The legacy-esque style of missions with new scenarios and cards coming out as you complete missions is pretty fun and adds a lot to the sense of discovery. The main reason why this game doesn't get a higher rating from me is the core game is built around the "command line" which is a programming mechanic. It's fine but doesn't really tickle my brain the way I want it to as the game is pretty light. I normally am not the biggest fan of programming but this is co-op programming which is new and frankly, better. It still has that "you're not totally in control of your own actions" feel that prevents me from liking this game even more. Don't get me wrong, this game is fun but I'm perfectly fine not owning it.</comment>

    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="Spain">Hard game to rate. Rules are pretty simple, but the first two scenarios were challenging. Production value is through the roof.   Much higher rating if played with kids. However, I am not sure about the replayability once you complete all the missions.  That said, we had a lot of fun playing this game. Right now, the main reason for not buying a copy is the humongous box it comes in.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">Production is over the top. Cooperative programming game with a dozen or so scenarios. I think this one plays better as a speed game. Too much time on the programming step leaves the puzzle quite easy to solve. Plus, as with games like Galaxy Truck, I think a significant appeal to this one is working with and/or suffering through the mishaps. </comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">This is smooth, simple, and enjoyable. The programming is fun and it has a really nice arc of gaining effectiveness as the game progresses, with your mech visually careening slightly out of control but wrecking tons of stuff.  I also love the psuedo-Legacy element of opening new scenarios with new goodies in each. A little slice of Christmas to chew on.  Of course, from a production standpoint it's unparalleled for the price. Probably the second highest produced game in my collection behind Kingdom Death: Monster.  Only downside is managing all of the minions movement and spawning can be tedious. The gameplay of the game is also slightly repetitive and the main spice is supplied via scenarios. Not sure if it will be all that thrilling when we run out of new ones to play. </comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United Kingdom">Very mixed views on this one:  + Great action selection mechanism  + Great asymmetrical factions. Definitely felt like I was playing Orks :)  + Like that the game promotes attacking while still giving you room to breathe + Good range of upgrade options, I like the action upgrades in particular and would've liked to see more + Combat is interesting on paper...  - ...but bloated and protracted in practice - Warp storms also good on paper but in practice drag out the game and feel a bit random - Downtime is awful in 4p, especially when combat is involved  - Overall felt too long for the play experience   Would play again (particularly at 3p) but honestly I'd just go the whole hog and play TI3 given the choice.</comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Singapore">A light weight wargame that is hyped by all the nice plastic minis it comes with.   Great production value. Components are top notch. Game play is actually very basic. The combat rounds uses a recurring damage and defence value that is hard for the loosing side to catch up with only combat cards. So it's like taking 3 damage followed by 4 damage then 5 damage (or more). Thus making warfare a stacking of hits and shields that could be counted upon on consecutive rounds.   In that sense, it favours the stronger attacks or defences right from round 1. It does not have the wild randomness of Axis and Allies type of combat resolution.   The cards do alter the combat effects and other resolution to maintain a fresh twist to each game.   Overall, a very simple wargame that is tight and light to play in an evening. Recommended as a beginner wargame of choice. </comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="">Sadly never to be updated now the license has gone but I do love myself some Wh40k. Modular board setup is nice for playing with different amount of players as well.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United Kingdom">Fantasy Flight's big boxes full of cards and plastic have a record with me that I'd politely describe as uneven.  Too often  I have found the game inside overwrought.  So Forbidden Stars was a pleasant surprise in its straightforwardness and lack of bloat.  The time-consuming combat system has drawn some criticism, but it can present some  interesting decisions for those involved.  In addition, the cards that make combat more than chucking a bucket of dice, do generate one of the trickier judgements in this game, which is how much effort you should put into building your deck.    Elsewhere, everything from the simple economy to the order placement to the warp storms and the objectives buried in opponents' territory works well with an absolute minimum of fiddle.  It feels as though every decision is significant, right from the initial placement of modular boards (strategic tip: don't allow anybody a chain of planets with no intervening voids  to all the objectives they need).  Forbidden Stars is a long game, but it remains engrossing to the end.  As noted by SirHandsome in his comments, the objectives work pretty well to solve the problem of endless back and forth squabbles, but do lead to piling on any faction that falls behind.    Production quality is to the usual good FFG standards.  The artwork will appeal rather more to teenage boys than it does to me.  I'm not convinced by the two rule books, which revive bad memories of Brass.  Do yourself a favour and print off Universal Head's summary.</comment>

Probably the only thing we didn't like about this game is the warp field. It's still hard to believe that a single game piece can cause such a ruckus! Lots of fun.</comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Okay so first off complaint about presentation: when we were going through the rules to this game as soon as I saw the forge icon beneath certain units I was like "Wow, that's hard to notice. I bet we'll forget about it a lot." Guess who had to call her second game a wash because her opponent forgot he had to pay forge tokens to build certain units and illegally built a bunch and started blocking her? THIS GIRL. WHOOO. Dammit, I would have won too.  That ONE complaint aside the rest of the presentation is good. Like, really good. I got this game on the heels of replaying TI3 for the first time in years and remembering just how bad the presentation was for so many things in TI3. Here everything (except the stupid forge icons!) feels smooth and simple - not a hair out of place.  Finally, someone has made a thematic area control space game that I, a lover of all things clean and elegant, can get down with. This finally feels like the game that will bridge the gap between myself and certain friends who balk at the idea of playing anything that doesn't have a million chits, 800 pages of rules, and flavor text on every single component.  And while this game doesn't have all of those things - the rules are long, but fairly straightforward. There's no flavor text, but the art and naming conventions make the theme very clear, and there are [i]just enough[/i] chits to get the job done [i]and not one more[/i]. But this game brings everything that is good about American games to the table and cuts out all of the fat normally associated with that school of design.  The flow of the game is dead simple, but strategically things are not quite so clear-cut. There's a lot to consider with every one of your actions, and thanks to the hidden information of the order tokens every choice feels tough and taxing (in a good way). It's not [i]exactly[/i] bluffing, but there's a level of mind games here I really appreciate that feels lacking in similar games.  I'm going to go off on a tangent about something a little weird here, but I think the Dominate action and asset tokens exemplify just what's so special about this game. It's a fairly minor feature, but this is [i]exactly[/i] the kind of tertiary system so many of these kinds of games get wrong. Instead of being somewhat divorced from the core gameplay loop, it's integrated right with everything else. And instead of just bringing a ton of content to the game to internalize and account for, it's the bare minimum amount for maximum effect. Every single one of these tokens feels useful in the core gameplay, and I think the whole thing speaks to just how well thought out this game is. Instead of including yet another system just for the simulation aspect, even the smallest of mechanics feels relevant and important.  Also worth pointing out that the combat here is much better than the standard roll-to-resolve system so many thematic conquest games employ. You can still feel pretty restricted by the dice though. Most cards are about manipulating the dice in some way, but it's entirely possible to roll such that your current hand of cards is useless, which sucks when it happens but the upgrade system gives you lots of opportunities to decide on which ways you're more reliant on your dice and which you're not. So yeah, bad luck can screw you and that feels as crappy as ever but in this game it feels more like isolated incidents, as you generally feel responsible for the deck choices you make and how that impacts your rolls.  That said... I'm not exactly sure what would cause one to choose different combat upgrades in different games. They don't feel particularly situational, so I could see just taking the same path over and over again. It sounds weird to say but I think Kemet's power tiles just had so many different combinations that while you can certainly just go the same route in that game every time, it wasn't as tempting to do so as it is here (at least, it didn't become so rote so quickly) - and added to that that other players can snatch up the tiles you want before you get them, etc., Kemet's upgrade system might actually feel more dynamic even though there's less random factors feeding into it.  I'm not sure I have a lot of complaints with the design of the game per se, but there are certain things I find strategically difficult about the game. Moreso than others in the area-control-by-conquest genre. For one, it can be difficult to keep in mind the hard limit of 8 dice per combat encounter, and accordingly tailor the units you take into battle. For example, in my second game I screwed myself by routinely bringing around enough guys to give me 8 dice right off the bat... with a handful of cards that each added a (now useless) die. This is the sort of thing it's going to take repeated plays to figure out, because the whole thing feels a bit unintuitive.  All in all, I'm pleased to finally have a thoroughly American game that I genuinely enjoy for those hangouts with my American gaming buddies - who previously found Kemet too Euro, Nexus Ops too simple. With Forbidden Stars I think FFG has taken a firm step forward in design and I now have high hopes for their future endeavors.  Update: Finally got in a 3p game of this after playing our first few games exclusively at 2p. I like 3p a little better, but still great with two!</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">1 play / 3 players  LIKE: The tile-laying puzzle element was a very involved, but excellent mechanism. I liked the different worker actions, they seemed well designed. There was almost a narrative arc to them. So many paths to explore. I felt some competition for certain spots and to claim bounties, which added a nice player tension.  DISLIKE: Too many options, at first. But as I went through the motions, I could see the different elements and efficient combos unfold. There is some die rolling randomness, and it is possible to have a poor turn. Some cards drawn are better than others, but this is minor.  OVERALL: Uwe is a master of great worker placement spectacles with incredible amount of paths-- or so it seems. Time will tell if there's a path in this game that's most efficient, but the player interaction on the board did feel competitive enough to directly slow another player down (just a little bit). </comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Denmark">I am usually a big Uwe fan boy, but this one fell flat for me. I didn't enjoy the puzzles, and the worker placement part didn't feel as tense as his other games.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="">There is lots about the game that I love.  However there feels a bit too much going on for my taste and I am not yet liking the tile placing/scoring aspects of the game.  For the moment I prefer other Uwe games but can see me enjoying my second play a lot more than my first.  There is a decent amount of theme here.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">There are a myriad of options and puzzle solving mechanics that the game tosses at you. "Sandbox" and "repetitive" were phrases that were used various times during our initial game. If you enjoy the resource conversion and efficiency exercises that a lot of Euros bring, then you'll enjoy this title.   I thought that the game, at four players, took too long for what it was. Then again, at three players, it would be less tense then it already is??? The amount of interaction is a lot less than Agricola and, to a lesser extent, than Caverna. The amount of action spaces and components look daunting at first, but once you road test a couple of rounds it all falls into place. It's an okay game and a good pastime when I'm in the mood for some puzzle solving.  All of this said, I've caught myself thinking about the game and what I would do differently afterwards. So; it does hold my interest.  Update:   It has gotten tighter and more interesting after several more plays. Raised a quarter point.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Netherlands">People seem to refer to this game as having aspects of Agricola and Patchwork. After having played this once I can see why. First, the artwork style is similar. And there is certainly an Agricola vibe going on, but luckily this game doesn't have the pressing of scarcity and famine of Agricola. Sure, you need to prepare an increasingly grand geast each round, but it's always managable. The patchwork part is the actual goal of the game; Tile-laying akin to Tetris.  Feast of Odin is an overwhelming game. It has tiles in dozens and dozens of forms and colours. It has resources (but only four types). It has dozens and dozens of action fields to choose from where you can collect or convert tiles and resources in some form. It has weapon cards (four types), it has hundreds of bonus cards divided in three categories, there are ships in three types. You have up to 12 workers to place, making the choice of one of the dozens of action fields even harder. There are even multiple playing boards to acquire in addition to the one you start with.  So much stuff.  Luckily the core is pretty simple. You want tiles to cover up empty spaces. That's basically it. The thinking part isn't so much how you want the tiles to fit, although that's a fun puzzle element. But the real AP moments are setting up the economic engine of upgrading the stuff you've accumulated in order to have more tiles use. The random bonus cards give you some strategic direction, which is helpful when you play the game for the first time.  After playing this once, I like to explore more. But our first game with three took over four(!) hours. That's a lot. It were fun hours though.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Canada">This has the exact same feeling as Fields of Arle, but with an added spatial element of some tile laying. Since I like Fields of Arle, I like this too. The problem is that they come across as virtually the same game.  I have been saying for a few years now that I would really like to see Uwe Rosenberg come up with some fresh ideas. His games have became so samey samey that they just feel completely derivative of his own past designs. The massive amount of action choices started with Agricola which morphed to even more action spaces with Le Havre which he put on steroids to come up with Ora et Labora and then Caverna. I suppose with this new rendition, at least we are spared the collecting of a bazillion eeples of resources.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">1-4 100-120 minutes Best with 2</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">Uwe's fans will be pleased. Here's another big chewy resource converter that is, thankfully, tighter than Caverna with some interesting new bits. I especially liked the "worker curve" and the way that the player boards were able to visually map out almost all of the game (hooray for easy post-game analysis!). However, as with other Uwe games of this weight, I got the feeling that this was very much a "throw it all in" style game that could have used some serious mechanical trimming. I think he's best when he stays focused (Patchwork, Le Harve, Agricola).</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Switzerland">Having too many options is just as frustrating as not having enough options. Worker placement without much interaction, there's always something useful you can do on your turn. Too puzzly for my taste. Don't get me wrong: it's a good Euro and I'll play along any time it is suggested but I'd rather play Caverna, thank you very much.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="Spain">Este juego es perfecto en su g&#233;nero. Las partidas iniciales son bastante largas pero merecen la pena de principio a fin. No es un juego que se pueda ense&#241;ar en 5 minutos y acabar en una hora. Si vas a ense&#241;ar a alguien a jugar mejor te aseguras de tener 3 o 4 horas disponibles para ese d&#237;a. Para mi es un juego redondo.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="Denmark">Starting to get the rules right. Heavy and can take some time to play, but a good game.  Rating will increase once we got the rules fully down.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="Greece">Well, this the most anticipated game that let me down. Too much complexity that does not produce a robust feel in the game, like MtG does. Although I have to say I do not like summoner wars, and this is something like summoner wars + a whole lot of spells. I feel a bit confused. This game has everything I would expect in a game and still I didn't like it as much as I predicted.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="Italy">Take Magic the Gathering, add a board and don't restrict players' choices with a hand, but let them play whatever they wish from the entire grimoire. This is Mage Wars. When I heard something like that, I thought it was insane and couldn't work. But it works, and the game is great! Mage Wars is the deckbuilder's dream, and it offers out of the box gazillions of options (something LCGs achieve only after MANY expansions and lots of money spent!). And it is also an engaging game, one where you can't have a hand that plays itself, one with real interaction, and where skill matters. A great, ambitious design. A great game.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">This is one of those games, I'm weary about playing because I feel like it is such a commitment.  It isn't something I'd like to teach someone to play as the rules are plentiful.  I believe videos are the way to go, if they are willing to watch and learn.  If they already know what they are doing and you can just play at a decent rate, the game can be enjoyable.  Sometimes I wish there was more randomness to it.  I only recommend it for seasoned gamers with time or people that are willing to put forth the time and effort it takes to become familiar with the complexities of the game/rulebook.  I'm sure I'd enjoy it more, if my gaming circle were a bit more advanced.  Looking forward to playing it years from now.  I gifted it to my son from my collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Canada">Auctions, role-selection, tile-laying, route-planning mechanics, and challenging economics (too challenging?) make for a very strategic game.  The only real downside is the terrible rulebook.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="">Martin Wallace's best economic game.  A turn opens with an intense bidding round followed by laying track tiles, shipping cubes, earning income and paying expenses.  Plenty of opprotunity to jack your opponents.  The only real weakness in the game is the urgency has a tendancy to drop off in the middle to late game.  Players are making so much money there's no threat of financial failure.  Instead it becomes a game of who can be the richest of the rich and the mightiest of the mighty.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Poland">Classic rail roads game. It has two weak points: serious king making possibility and danger of long turn time, especially when at least two experienced players analyse the situation on board.  Ranking 7 overall, 8 for playing with players that make theirs decisions fast. </comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Switzerland">I am not a great fan of Age of Steam. There are multiple barriers which lead to this situation: first of all, the quality of the artwork is very poor. It's an important factor for me in the purchase of a game and Age of Steam is not up to my standards (I'm not into fine detailed but an overall flavour and style is very much appreciated in a game). Then, I came to this game a bit late with players who already knew it. This made my first games not that much enjoyable. Still, I've now enjoyed a first (shared) victory at that game. Finally, there is a lot of interaction in that game and it is not always easy to foresee. That added to some complexity in the games itself (calculation, auctions) makes it a difficult game to get into and a long game to play prone to some analysis paralysis. Still, I'm sure it's a game worth working on... I'm looking forward to the next edition to solve some of the issues I have with the game. I can't wait for it.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">great game. Love the mechanics, the theme, just about everything. Would like to play more</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United Kingdom">I really want to play this much more, like most of Wallace's best games (i.e the brain burning ones), people avoid it and go for something like Steam instead but it's the tense, tinkering on bankruptcy, make a mistake early and you are dead in the water sort of system that I enjoy the most. I need to recruit more followers now that Steam has trained up some of the fence sitters in how to play pick up and deliver games, they can try this as there is really nothing to be scared about?! </comment>

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Canada">The first time through this one is tough.  It is a long game and the rules need a cheat card for each player.  Needs another playing, but the others didn't see the point in playing it again...  Played it a second time.  This is NOT a light game by any means and can cause serious headaches.  It is a good game, but may not be your thing if you don't enjoy heavy thrash strategy games.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">Maybe the most tense, cutthroat, unforgiving game I've played to date. It's a great game and has lots of replayability with the different maps, but it's a little long, a little fiddly, and the art and components are terrible.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Greece">Great pick up and deliver game. Money is tight. There are a lot of interesting decisions and the game flows nicely. Rules are easy to teach for a game of this weight (on the other hand the rulebook is badly written and can be confusing at times). There are some minor production issues like the colour of cubes not matching the colour of the cities on the board. Some might say that considering the high cost of this game, these problems are unacceptable.  </comment>

I am a little concerned that there are not that many strategies that you can employ to win, but the basic concept is amazing. The person who creates the best combinations wins the game, which is right up my alley!  Update: It's not as fun as the first few playthroughs just because it is a little bland.

    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">Ever wondered what it'd feel like to be debeers? I am always up for a game of splendor. It is a well designed game involving a little luck but mostly skill. You spend your rounds either acquiring gems or using them to purchase mines that auto produce buying power and sometimes have victory points. You are attempting to obtain enough buying power to purchase enough mines to gain enough victory points to win. If you purchase the right configurations, you also attract nobles worth points and speed along your victory. This game was second place in the spiel to camel up and I believe the first game by space Cowboys. Thankfully not their last.</comment>

    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="United Kingdom">An interesting game with some good mechanics.   I don't like it with 5 players, I find the lack of buildings for everyone to get at least 5 of them is a big problem and artifically forces up the value of recruiter cards when you need to be buying other stuff. The recruiter card feels odd being in the auction section when extra building cards are not, maybe they should have a flat fee higher than a building.  Puts player number 2 in a great position to the get the extra card for much less than everyone else will need to pay for a recruiter. Also, with 5 players you are much more under the influence of using what you get in the inital draw, with fewer players you get more opportunity to tailor your hand. </comment>

    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="Canada">I enjoyed PoF because it's a relatively short, compact game that has multiple strategies for scoring points. The game is 7 rounds long, which takes between 1-1.5 hours to play. My favourite element of PoF is that it forces you to adapt depending on the game situation.  In PoF, you are forced to pick a strategy fairly early in the game, plan out several moves ahead, re-evaluate and modify your strategy based on auction results, and react to what other players are doing. There never seems to be enough rounds to do everything you want, and yet you have to figure out a way to make it work. Since you are limited in what you can do in the action phase, you need to ensure that you time your actions properly.   On the other hand, my sister is not a big fan of the game. She says that it feels like she's trying to catch a runaway train (in this case, the work value minimum goes up each round). She says that you're always running out of time and money, and you can't do everything that you want to do. She'd also doesn't like that you can only perform some actions only once during the action phase (i.e. buying a freedom or profession card). She likes Power Grid better.   RULE MISHAP: We thought that you could only have 1 action for the round if you selected a freedom or profession - my sister is interested in trying PoF again to see if the game improves. For me, it may make my rating go up!   UPDATE 1: Now with a few more game titles under my belt and having played PoF with heavy board gamers, I've downgraded my rating. There are just so many other board games I would pick to play over this one now - whether it be a heavier one or a light, short game. UPDATE 2: Not as interested in playing this one, but maybe the reissued, redesigned edition will spark my interested. 2015 UPDATE: hard-to-read card text, boring graphics and theme, restrictive building placement, and dated art puts this one in the trade pile.</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">Enjoyed the LOTR theme, and the game was inelligently made. I bought it for solo play, which made the game VERY difficult. Playing solo as two players is better, but circling the table over and over isn't the best experience. Still enjoy the depth of the game, and it made me want to buy expansions. Definite bonus that it made me crave more and think way to long about deck building strategy, but negative points for the high cost for only 3 single (and one or two ridiculously hard, given the limited player cards) scenarios. Would maybe bump up the score if I had a gaming partner.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">I do like this game quite a bit -- enjoying both the theme and the way the game mechanics work. A couple ticks: 1. I bought it for solo play, which is MUCH harder than a I thought it would be (playing solo as two players is fine but not my favorite). 2. There are only three scenarios included, one of which is fairly impossible to win without shedding more money out on extra cards/expansions. Still fun but a nuisance. I enjoy the rigorous deck building but not the necessity to spend tons of money to build something great. If I had someone else to play with who was also into deck building, I'd probably raise my rating a notch or two.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">Reserving rating until more time with this title. So far, it's kicking our butts.  Update: One victory (Spirit), many losses (assorted). The theme is captured nicely. The "excruciating decision making" aspect of the game helps capture the challenge of the storyline as well. So far, we really enjoy this title.  </comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">Difficult to play and win, solo. Not a bad game, but it feels too much like it's contrived. I don't know what to think of it at this point.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Scotland">Excellent solo game that backs up as a great light fantasy campaign game for my play group.

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="">Got this mainly because it's great in solo mode.  It's also *tough*.  In solo play it's almost impossible to succeed at the last campaign unless editing the base deck and getting a bit lucky. Some would say that the game is too difficult and that this is rather transparent ploy to force you to buy more cards... Anyway, it's a decent price for the base set, with great art work and nice components, so maybe buying an expansion or two isn't unreasonable.  Great theme and fans of LOTR, co-ops and fantasy genre will really enjoy this.  Shame it's hard to get hold of the expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United Kingdom">Would of got a better score from me, if more cards were available in the basic set, rather than try and make players buy two main sets. Otherwise a nice co-operative game. </comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Norway">A bit disappointing at least with the pre-build decks as the spirit deck is the only one that stands a chance (can keep the threat-level down) - but seriously lack fighting skills. Not to happy about this one - considering a sale.  Sold and bought again. It is on the rise, rating wise. </comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United Kingdom">Bought on June 4th 2011 at the UK Games Expo, Birmingham. FFG have made an error here in that the number of cards available in this core set is in my opnion insufficient to provide a good variety of games, and even to allow any success at the harder two out of only three scenarios provided. Another 30 cards for aother 5$ or &#163; would have helped hugely. So to feel pressured into buying a SECOND core set just to make it work is poor. The other LCGs available are not as bad as this one for this sort of error. Call of Chthulu and Game of thrones DO play well enough out of the core set. This is a bitch to win esp. solo. Excellent, excellent ideas and artwork and quality let down by insufficient material.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Canada">Thematically, this is such a treat!  Excellent artwork and flavour.  I am sure that with more plays its rank could climb.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Brazil">Good game, simple and fast, the Fantasy Flight LCG system benefits the game a lot, I believe the game is with a lot of flavors now and a lot of options.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Canada">A race game where the goal is to be the first to collect a set number of rubies, while travelling/route-planning on a modular board.  On your turn, you move your stack of pieces in a limited fashion (orthogonal, and up to 2 spaces) and either collect a piece you left behind on a tile and perform the action of that tile/location or leave a piece of your stack behind and perform the action (this movement is very similar to Dorn's Traders of Genoa).  There are several different tiles with different actions but they generally consist of: a) getting more resources to put in your wagon, getting money, acquiring rubies (which generally require expenditure of money and/or resources), and acquiring abilities/benefits (such as an upgraded wagon, special powers).  There are a few characters which you may encounter on your travels and you can interact with them for a small fee resulting in a small bonus.  This game is relatively simplistic even though it is somewhat interesting.  Having played the base game and the expansion, I wouldn't go back without the expansion as it adds some more options/paths to a game that's pretty limited decision-wise.  I'm a bit surprised for the love this game is getting, even as a hardcore Rudiger Dorn fan, I'd rate this about his 5th best game.  Only played as a 2er, but it works very well at that count, which is a real plus.  Very nice components.  Own the [boardgame=172505]Mocha &amp; Baksheesh[/boardgame] and the [boardgame=192779]Brief &amp; Siegel[/boardgame] expansions and the [boardgame=161224]Kebab Shop[/boardgame] spielbox promo.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Wales">Nothing tremendously new here, and not a lot to pick this over Royal Palace or Louis XIV which have similar mechanics. Perhaps this is a worthy upgrade, but still very familiar. That said, as dry optimisation exercises go, this is a good one. A standard, sensible, Euro game. I enjoyed it but wasn't excited by it.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">Not Constantinople is great game. The board is modular and has several configuration options to keep things interesting. The premise is that you are a merchant trying to collect a certain number of rubies first. You do so by moving around the board and triggering specific actions where you drop off subordinates, or as I like to call it, "pooping" on various spots of the board. This innovative pooping mechanic forces you to be efficient with the actions you choose because when you run out of poops you have to either go back to a spot where you left a turd or waste a turn activating a tile that allows you to collect all your poops back. The idea is to be as efficient as possible in executing various pick up and delivers as possible while creating synergies between certain board tiles so that you are minimizing your need to waste actions. Istanbul is a solid game... Poop.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">1st play: This was a smooth game, and I think it flows a lot better than Traders of Genoa. The breadcrumb mechanic is well implemented here, and the variable board means that there should be lots of replay-ability. Also, the components are nice and turns flow fast. If anything, the game was over too soon.  2nd play: Fast fun game, rules are very smooth to teach and people generally understand quickly how to play. I like the route building and with variable setups the game plays differently each time.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Brazil">It is a race game. Easy to teach and easy to play, with some interesting decisions and position and path chosen matters a lot. Other than that, I think I expected a little bit more from this game.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">Played demo at GenCon 2014.  Very interesting and reminds me of Trade of Genoa (without the negotiation) meets Blue Moon City.  You collect goods, exchange them for money, which you then in turn exchange for victory points (completing wheelbarrow, completing add-ons, changing resources/money into victory points).  The escalating cost of exchanging into victory points is very similar to Blue Moon City and causes a very anxious game where you have to out-race other people.  Update: Played a second time and it kinda fell flat.  What was interesting the first game became repetitive in the second.  Downgrading it to a 7, possibly a 6. . </comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="">Fun game! The game plays well with 4-5 players. With less players the market feels emptier and the optimal path is easier to discern. With more, the game becomes a bit too chaotic, but really makes it feel like you're running around a bustling market.  ~10 Play Update: Getting too predictable. I wish there were more location tiles for a variable set of locations. Dropping score to 7 since I don't want to play as much anymore.</comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">Played with 3 and was very good. Definitely need to play more.</comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="Canada">A mish-mash of tried and true mechanics lifted from other games (Luna, Glory To Rome, Agricola, Yspahan), combined with some new ideas that all comes together in a very cohesive, fun, and strategic game about building up your farming principality over 6 rounds of play.  Each player starts the game with their own farm/player mat that has 4 sides for slotting cards to develop their farm, as well as a hand of cards (also a pittance of money, resources and points to start).  A game round consists of 4 phases which are very nicely laid on clear player aids.  In the first phase (Farming), players play a card to their principality and each card has potentially 4 different functions only 1 of which will be used (as a field to grow crops, as a contract to complete for points, as a farm extension to improve your farm's "abilities", or as a unique farmer ability similar to Agricola).  Then players receive income, which early on is limited and is generally coins, then they potentially get crop growth and animal reproduction (pigs are the only animal in the game and it's difficult to reproduce them), then they can purchase (optionally) a roof, which is like a delayed free action that costs money but also grants a small amount of points (you have 6 rounds to buy 5 roofs so you can get away with not purchasing once if you're short on coin).  The second phase is Income and here the starting player rolls dice which are allocated to resources/actions that players will choose in turn order (each player gets 2 die therefore 2 actions, which could potentially be the same).  Finally 1 die will be left over and all players get this action.  This is a phase that's good for everyone but it is a bit unpredictable and going earlier in turn order is preferable.   The third phase is Deliveries/Siesta.  Each player has an identical set of action tiles that are a mix of deliveries (donkey symbols) and/or siesta (a snoozing hat).  Players secretly choose their tile and reveal in turn order and they are either moving up on the siesta track (for small amount of points and advancement in turn order) or they are choosing to deliver goods to contracts.  If you deliver goods, you can deliver to your own personal contracts (market barrows) and/or to the main board (craft buildings).  There are advantages to both; market barrows when completed give you points, a free trade good (these are flexible resources that can be cashed in at any time), and a placement in the market that has the same mechanics as the temple in Luna (you can bump out other players for points and you score points for each marker at the end of the round).  Craft buildings give you points based on the round (later is better) and grant a craft token, of which there are 6 different ones and they pay out a bonus each round so the earlier you get them the better (that's the tradeoff).  The last phase is Scoring, where you score for your placement in turn order and for markers present in the main market.    The game scales very well from 2-4 players (haven't played solo yet, but it does play solo), it actually runs very smoothly and quickly (shorter than the box says) and it has definite replayability due to all of the unique cards and options with the cards.  Seems ripe for an expansion and definitely deserves the wider release it will be getting.  Own the [boardgame=178452]promo cards[/boardgame].</comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">This isn't my normal type of game. I like Euros that are slick and tight with some original sparkle. La Granja is none of that. It's a sprawling cacophony of interlocking bits. It mirrors many other games - Agricola in growing crops, Yspahan in dice allocation of actions, countless Euros in converting one thing to another. This game will confuse and thus punish first time players which limits appeal. But with all that, I still want to play it again - and maybe a few times. It has lots of area to explore for sure - even with the mechanical nonsense.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">Good game but success is in the card combos.  Don't get a good combo going soon enough?  You're done.  Half the trick is having a good combo available, half the trick is recognizing you have the combo available, and half the trick is execution.  (Yes, that's a lot of halves - deal with it.)

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">Overall, I enjoyed my first play of La Granja. Mechanically, this is a euro with a very interesting mix of mechanics; It has the card-play of Glory to Rome and the dice drafting of Bora Bora. For gamers that enjoy medium-weight euros, this game certainly warrants a look.  That being said, I question the longevity of this game because it seems too well-balanced. The balance issues seem to stem from the fact that there are numerous ways to do the same thing, which mitigate the importance of any one decisions. Furthermore, this attribute reduces the tension in the game and shifts this euro more towards the solitaire experience.   Again, I need to play the game more to fully appreciate it. But I see the game more as a mix of interesting ideas rather than the epitome of good game design. Still, I had fun playing it and look forward to my next game. </comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">La Granja is more streamlined and mainstream than most of the other Spielworxx titles that I've played. It's a mid weight solid game with a hodgepodge of mechanics that work well. While not introducing something incredibly innovative, what it does it does well.  What I enjoy about the game is the puzzle of trying to figure which card you are playing, where you are playing it, how your engine develops from there and the timing of the deliveries. You are basically playing cards from your hand into your farm which will dictate in which direction you are headed. It was fun and interesting making these decisions. Most of the time you are in your own little world converting resources and figuring out the timing of things; so it does have a multiplayer solitaire feel to it, but nothing major that would detract from the game. From there, it is mostly your standard Euro where you are converting this into that, albeit with a certain charm to it.  There are two main ways of making points; delivering goods to the Craft buildings or to the Market stalls. The player interaction comes in trying to deliver the goods first to gain extra points in the Craft buildings which grant tiles that benefit you for the rest of the game and timing your deliveries to the Market stalls to gain extra points by knocking out players from the center of the board. The player interaction is not enough to make a big difference or huge impact in negating your opponent of some crucial necessity. The interaction was described in my group as minimal. I personally don't mind this, but some do.  La Granja is a solid game with interesting decisions, great production values and fun gameplay. </comment>

    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United Kingdom">Kind of a classic euro.  I liked it and would play again, but it seems that certain portions of the board tend to get a lot more action than others.  I've only played one side of the board though, so maybe that would change?  Plenty to think about.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United Kingdom">The more I play this game, the less and less I like it. Perhaps it's because I've been playing 5 player rather than 3 when I initially played. There just doesn't feel like enough time to do anything and the game is over before it really gets going. Also feel that the scoring circles aren't worth enough. Need extra circles/colours and to complete a 4 route to get the points.</comment>

I found that it really took me most of the game to figure out what I wanted to do, and what would earn me decent VP. It felt chaotic and the end game condition of running out of those bonus chits seemed so arbitrary that the game felt like it was cut short and abruptly. However, I still think I want to try the game again before I pass judgement on it because it did seemed nicely streamlined as a Euro with a tiny bit of area control, which I like.

    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United Kingdom">An austere Euro whose Hanseatic trading theme is so thin it could as easily have been about the spread of viruses in the human body.  Happily, a good game lies underneath the paper thin theme and the uninspiring artwork.  At heart, the game is classic Euro fare: develop an engine that allows you to do more things more efficiently and keep that in balance with doing other things that score you victory points.  Where Hansa scores with me is by adding a hefty amount of player interaction.  This isn't just about beating opponents to actions they also wish to take, it's   exploiting their actions for your own advantage and making the things they need to do more costly.  The game also feels quite dynamic, with quick player turns in which pieces are placed, moved and taken off the board.  While I may be thwarted this turn, there's every possibility that by next turn my way will be clear. A good game, with multiple strategic possibilities and yet somehow it doesn't excite me.  Production quality is decent.  The artwork is dull but functional.  The rules suffered somewhat in translation to English.    </comment>

An excellent handicapping system allows players of disparate skill levels to play each other fairly evenly, though the depth of play can be intimidating for beginners.   However, the game may be too deep to warrant regular play from me. I feel it's similar to Chess in the way that study and memorization of specific game states greatly improves one's skill at the game, Go's handicapping and lack of arbitrary rules makes the game significantly more appealing for me. I just can't give the game the attention it deserves and balance it against other interests. </comment>

    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="Hong Kong">The abstract strategy game with the most depth.  Rather simple rules and very profound strategy.  But it is really a very heavy game which is not very accessible to novice players: you really need to be taught by a good coach (or read a good book) in order to "get started" into the game, kind of like golf or tennis; if you just learn the rules and try to explore the game on your own, it's probably a waste of your time.  A bit over-analysed by the experts, which sometimes undermines the enjoyment a bit for casual players (like me).  The best game for serious intellectual challenge, clearly above chess and the other classics.</comment>

    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="Australia">I'm taking the subjective 'what do you feel like playing right now' side of the ranking system seriously with this score; obviously Go is a 10 from plenty of other angles.  But to newbies like me, who've read an introductory book and blundered around against other newbies, a 7 seems honest reflection of the amount of work standing between me and proper appreciation of the game. By the way, what's with the 2000BC?  As I understand it there's quite a debate on the dating of Go, and that one looks like an outlier.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United Kingdom">one of the most innovative worker placement. If you like WP you need this one in your collection. Apart from the new twist it is a really good game.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="Canada">A thematic and surprisingly original take on the tried and true worker placement genre.  As per usual, the goal of the game is to score the most points by game end, and there are many ways to score these points.  You start the game with a player mat which has a clock of sorts that marks the passage of time depending upon the actions that you take.  Your actions consist of taking an action cube (which is a currency of sorts and which comes in 5 colours) and then performing that action, and depending on the action you may also have to spend time and/or grain which is another form of currency.  Actions consist of such things as: currying favour in the city council, entering the priesthood, selling goods at the market, travelling/adventuring, crafting goods or paying a craftsman to make them for you, and having a child.  The trick is that your workers have an expiry date, and when their time is up, they die and are removed from the game.  The neat catch is that in addition to this being a trigger for game end (the cemetary or book of legends fills up with the deceased) it can also be one of the many ways to score points- if you manage to die at the right time and place you can put your deceased family member in a book of legends which is worth more points the more family members you get in there.  The ways to score points are myriad: dying (appropriately), adventuring, working your way up the ranks in the church, selling goods at the market, maintaining a high position in city council.  The game can play quickly or long depending on what players are working towards.  You can win with many or few family members, the scalability is great for 2-4 (and now 5 with the expansion), and the artwork is nice and the theme fits nicely.    Own the [boardgame=136223]Village Inn[/boardgame] and [boardgame=155996]Village Port[/boardgame] expansions and the [boardgame=124118]Customers[/boardgame], [boardgame=166592]Customers 2[/boardgame] and [boardgame=168122]Schatzkiste[/boardgame] promos.  The Village Inn is an easy add-on and should be considered essential.  It adds components for up to 5 players and the game works well with 5, but it also adds a new location and set of options (the Beer maker and Inn/Tavern)- you can produce beer with one action (a craftsman action) and go to the tavern with another, and with this action you gain access to unique power cards (personalities) that give one-time in game bonuses or end game scoring bonuses.  Basically this option opens up more paths to explore without being unbalanced.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">Very much has a "Stone Age" feel to it, but really interesting mechanic with the dying meeples and all.  I've found that with the groups I play with it is a little more AP-inducing than Stone Age, although not really being a significantly heavier game.    I'd be really interested to try the Port expansion for this, as the travel track as it stands in the original seems to be far to great an investment for the benefits provided.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="Canada">Interesting gateway type worker placement/get resources/take actions to score points game with an unusual twist: a valid strategy is to kill off your workers! That's because filling up the scroll of honourable dead (or whatever it's called) gives you points.  Fun for non-hardcore gamers as it is easy to pick up strategy as you basically look at what others are doing and try to do something different.  Of the point generating spaces, the market seems to be needed in most games so there may be some "sameness" developing over time.  Still, a great game to play with family and friends who are casual gamers or may be just getting into more mid-weight games.  One major caveat: if you are colour deficient you will have a hard time with the board and the cubes. The orange and pink cube representations on the board are strangely similar and I have a difficult time telling them apart, especially on the travel section of the board.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">This is a well-designed game with lots of neat mechanisms: some new, some old.  Unfortunately, it was long and just wasn't fun enough for the work put into it.  I think it's a good game, but it will be hard to get it to the table often.  Update: Upgraded to a 7, but I very well may not keep it.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="Singapore">A medium light reverse worker placement game. Very clear cut view of an elegant game system that works. Like all Eurogames, different ways to score has always been interesting, as if you are playing multiple different games all at the same time... Nothing that new, but the theme was refreshing and getting all the bits to work and gel together with color cubes was very well done.  Overall a very good 'light medium light' game, that is fun for multiple plays.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">PROS  - Time mechanic of your workers dying is new and interesting - Not exactly traditional worker placement since you're not placing workers all the time - All sorts of strategies to pursue and different options on what to do to win - Colorful board - The expansion makes it more fun and I'd say it's a requirement  CONS - Theme is kind of there, but not as well as it could be - The board is a little convoluted at times.

    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="Australia">Played just the once and went down in flames, but I'd certainly be up for more games of this.  Good as the game is, I'm a little puzzled as to why it's performing so much better here on BGG than many other excellent traditional card games.  Sure, BGGers tend to be hostile to mainstream games with a million analysts, like Bridge or Poker, but there's a lot of great deep but relatively unanalysed games out there like Solo Whist, Scopone or Piquet, and I just don't see how it is that Tichu rates the pants off them.</comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="United States">Simple game with a lot of depth when you get into it. Quick rounds helps offset bad rounds with good rounds though annoying luck fluctuations can lead to runaway winners. It's giant flaw is the "Calling Tichu" mechanic. Rather than having a game mechanic which would assist what would be considered a "bad hand" the Tichu bet takes a hand that would have already been considered a good hand without the bet and turns it into a fantastic hand.</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Finland">This is of the same good quality with the rest of the TtR family, i.e., one of the best casual family games in the market.  However, I really do not like the tunnel mechanic with its random take that aspect. In this sense, TtR Nordic Countries is on the same line with TtR Europe. But what sets TtR Nordic apart is that it really shines with 2-3 players. Compared to the original game, the board of Nordic version is also much tighter with low player numbers forcing the players to make some early plays instead of just hoarding cards. And compared to the M&#228;rklin edition, Nordic edition less fiddly sharing the elegancy of the original.  Original = Best for families with 4-5 players M&#228;rklin = Most satisfactory for gamers Nordic = Best for families with 2-3 players Europe = worst of the bunch in all aspects</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">Rating TTR series as a whole.  My favorite for a 2-3 player version of Ticket to Ride.  Probably doesn't play well with super aggressive players.  In our house we seem to have an unstated gentleman's agreement that you don't claim a route purely to screw another player (i.e, we claim the routes we are using to complete our tickets, we don't just claim routes to prevent others from completing their tickets).    After a few plays, it is pretty easy to figure out which destinations people are building towards when they make certain moves, so with aggressive players it is very easy to just block a key route and completely break the other person's game (particularly in a two player game where double routes can't be utilized).  If everyone plays aggressively and enjoys it then at the end everyone can laugh about the winner being the person with the negative score closest to zero.</comment>

Interesting variation with ferries and tunnels and a smaller board with fewer trains per player.  Don't quite like it as much as the original, but I think that might be because I can't seem to keep myself from playing too aggressively...</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Croatia">Only played couple of games, but like Switzerland better. Still good standalone game, gives more color options for train carts, game comes with black, white and purple train carts so in theory you can play more then 5 people if you have Ticket to Ride USA/Europe on those maps. Can't recommend that though.  This and Switzerland are designed so you can block each other, that rarelly happens in our games, we usually focus on our destination.</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">A nice edition of the basic TtR game.  The routes are interesting and the map plays very well with 2 and 3 players.  The switch from longest route to most tickets is also nice contrast to base game play.  Overall - a solid production and a good edition to the TtR family.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="New Zealand">Probably the Ticket to Ride I'd be most inclined to play apart from the original. My unfamiliarity with the locations is going to continue to slow me down unless I play a lot more than I expect to.</comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">04-27-2015: After two plays, this could go up to an 8 or further down to a 6 or 5 based on how the next play goes. I've played three of Ignacy's games now (this along with Witcher and Robinson Crusoe) and the overwhelming feeling I've had through three different games and 7-8 hours of combined gameplay is: frustration. They haven't been fun, which to me is a cardinal sin for a board game.  I think this one would probably be best capped at 1-2 players. Restricting it to one action per player per turn makes the game exponentially longer. I need to play a card, so I do an action that gives me resources. Wait. Wait. Wait. Spend those resources to play the card. Wait. Wait. Wait. Use an action to get people. Wait. Wait. Wait. Play people on the card for points. Sigh... this makes me really appreciate games like Manhattan Project where I can do a similar series of turns in about 30 seconds.  It's very much a multiplayer solitaire. Unless someone is killing your cards you don't really care what anyone else is doing. The 45-90 minutes suggested game length is laughable. Our two games so far with three and four players have taken 2-3 hours each. You only go through a portion of your deck so it's very luck dependent on what cards you happen to draw. And hopefully if you were lucky enough to draw a good card you got it earlier in the game rather than later.  I feel this game would be really great if you could cut down on the game length and make the card draws more strategic versus luck-based (ability to look through your deck rather than shuffle and hope). This should also be 90 minutes at most but it's never been close to that for us.  Disclaimer: I usually play as the color red, so both games so far I played with Romans. If there is a combination of cards I should play, I haven't found them yet.  UPDATE 05-05-15: I played it again as a 2 player game with my wife and enjoyed it a lot more that way - significantly less downtime - and played as the Barbarians rather than the Romans.  UPDATE 06-06-15: I played again as the Japanese and won handily, after finishing in last place my first three games. I don't see my rating going up much at all from here. I feel about this game similar to the way I feel about Seasons -- great components, great cards, but in order to win I have to be a jerk, and I hate those types of games.</comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Wales">Font size and iconography are incredibly small and this immediately makes the game look a little amateurish, which is a shame because it's a fairly complex design. That's not to say that it's complex to play - the rules are extremely intuitive. There is a lot of attacking (with a variant ruleset to reduce this, which I think will be ignored by most players). The negative interaction is a downside for me, but I'm sure others will love it. This is straight-up resource-gathering/engine-building and there is nothing particularly innovative here, but it is done well.</comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Finland">The funniest part of the game is to figure out new card combos. And best part is that only a limited amount is available to you at the same time. Thus the option space is not infinitely large making the game relatively quick playing. Building your empire and seeing it grow is nice and every round there are a number of tough decisions, too.  All this makes the game quite satisfying.  However, despite of occasional razing and a few drafted cards the game lacks player interaction. Basically the game is a race for points, and in all races you should have a way to block other players. In Imperial Settlers you have none. Ok, you can raze but that is a reaction rather than proactive course of action. In other words, Imperial Settlers is a bit of a solitaire. </comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">Don't let the cutesy art and misleading title fool you. This is a well crafted civ building game by Portal where you draft cards to build the most kick ass empire you can. Sometimes you raise buildings, sometimes you make deals with other cultures, sometimes you exploit your civilizations synergies to achieve good outcomes and depreciate your opponents. It all ends up looking like a bunch of Care Bears trying to murder each other with butcher knives. Fun times.</comment>

Not purchased yet, not sure I have to players for it, also waiting for an eventual french traslation.  Drawings are cute but too small</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United Kingdom">Not bad, but I felt the game was missing something. The special abilities had not been thought out properly.  The second game was the same, bad draws and a special ability that was not useable in this example due to limited opportunities to get the resource in question. Both games felt very limited and just meandered along.</comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Canada">Surprisingly easy to learn and play. Raze tokens are few and far between if the cards don't favour you which can really kneecap some things and completely devalue certain cards. Letting you exchange people for them, even at a higher exchange rate, would fix this. Unfortunately the game feels like it's lacking a little something to make it great; something like additional end game scoring like a personal objective - just something to introduce a bit of uncertainty as to what the final score will be as opposed to being able to tell who's going to win by counting buildings. Nice game overall but just not something we really have an interest in keep in our collection. Sold.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">Just as solid a game as 51st State. Designed by the same man it both expands and simplifies that game. Which can be a total Catch 22 because maybe what you like is the complexity. Or maybe you like the game play but complexity of it bogs you down. It's a toss up really but a simple decision if you like 51st State but find yourself bogging down in its game play pick this game up instead. </comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Cayman Islands">This is  simplified 51 State with new graphics. Faster, easier but fun is also huge! For casual players it is perfect! For Pro ... play 51 State! </comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Australia">An extremely strategic and brain burning Euro.  Some consider it a bit bland and it is certainly on the more abstract side of things, but I don't find it bland at all - the main theme of the game - the ebb and flow of the ancient civilisations on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates comes out really well in this game, and the strategies are deep and engaging. Better yet, it is highly playable as a two player game which most Euros aren't, and that is a big plus because I am not sure about the downtime and the AP that will be exhibited with more players.</comment>

Limited actions make the game run smoothly, yet not so limited as to deny interesting decisions. However, despite how well-crafted the game is, I don't find much desire to bring this to the table. It may just be a problem with my play group, who I feel are a bit passive with this game, but even the more interactive sessions feel a bit dry and underwhelming. I definitely love the victory point system and the fact that your points are hidden.  Update (12/07): After gently pushing my group in a more aggresive direction, the game became much more interesting and fun. 7-&gt;8</comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United States">This is one of those games that has rightfully earned its place in the top 10 games of all time. True the theme is weak (although I think it's not all that bad really), but the system is so simple and so deep - it's really wonderfully assembled. The lowest score of your set of scores wins, so you have to carefully balance all opportunities. An experienced player will definitely trounce a new player and equally skilled opponents will almost certainly be determined by the luck of the draw. Still, no doubt this game is smart and thinky. Wonderful!</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Hungary">The connection between theme and gameplay is ridicoulos. For the first time I had been impressed by the game, but later I found it boring.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United Kingdom">Now that I've played this more, I've increased my rating.  I still don't feel that I understand the strategy of the game which makes it very newbie unfriendly. Something I'd like to explore more as I still don't understand the feedback mechanism (What did I do that caused me to lose?)</comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Canada">This game has been around for almost two decades and is still among the top 25 games on BGG.  Very nice looking game that offer a great harmony between strategic and tactical play. Nice mechanics that rewards players with balanced approach, a game aspect that I really like.  It truly is a one of the best gamer's game around and should be part of any serious gamers collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">One of Stefan Feld's best. It has typical Feldsy scoring at the end (VP potpourri) and the rotating cube mechanic is quite unique. </comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United Kingdom">If you are looking for a game which offers multiple ways to win and so many ways to score points so that you can apply different strategies, this is the game for you. It is a game that looks heavy but it is not (I am assuming you are a gamer and not a newbie). Wow. I would play over and over and every single game will always be different.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Denmark">We got this because my wife and I, absolutely love The Castles of Burgundy. We were a bit overwhelmed the first time we played it, but already the second time we had it hit the table, most of the things just "clicked". We played  a full game in about 1&#189; hour, and that is just the right time for a game like this.  A bit heavier and meatier than Burgundy, but it has not yet surpassed it. Atleast not for me, but I think my wife like this more.  Played our 5th game with more than two, for the first time. We were 4. The two newcomers had not played it before. The game lenght was fine, and we had a good time, but I do enjoy it with two players more. For 4 players, it will only get a 7/10 by me.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Canada">A victory points (VP) grabfest with a thin but pleasant enough Roman theme.  The game consists of 4 years, with each year consisting of 4 rounds, with a nice twist in that the length of a round is variable depending on the actions that players choose.  The core mechanic is unique (at least to me) in that you move clockwise and stepwise, action markers around a "rondel" of sorts and choose the action where you placed last with your action marker.  There are 6 different actions to choose from, and all of them are generally good although some are significantly better than others depending on the situation/your setup/end of game bonus cards etc.  After movement of action markers, you can potentially complete a bonus trajan tile (which awards points and a one-time ability bonus) if you've set yourself up/planned appropriately, then you get the one action you landed on.  Actions are: 1)military conquests, which have multiple options, but which can score points, 2) construction, which scores one-time points and either allows for big end game points or one-time immediate second action, 3) trajan tile selection, which can be used to replenish your "rondel" and thus score you more points and get you more benefits, 4) shipping, which is an opportunity to score big points by playing goods cards in one of 3 different possible combinations, 5) senate action, which scores points, and positions you for first choice at end of round bonus tiles, which can score big points at game end, and 6) forum, which is where you grab tiles such as votes for senate, requirements for the people, extra action bonuses.  At the end of a year, you need to satisfy the needs of the people or lose negative points (kind of like feeding your family in Agricola but not as punitive, and not as punitive as some other Feld games).  Again at end game, points are scored in addition to the points accumulated in game (the in-game points are very significant as well as the end-game ones).  Seems to scale very well (2-4 players), solid components, smooth and easy to play, but alot of options and difficult to determine which is the best one.  Definitely a solid euro gamers game.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="">Stefan Feld master piece. A unique game like no other.  A mancala type mechanism to determine actions and collect bonuses + worker placement to collect tiles, tiles sets, bonuses and victory points + a card hand management sub-system(seaport action) to meld commodities and collect victory points... this game simply has every single thing a gamer would desire in a game. Sounds complex, but it's really not.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Full of Feld-y goodness!  So many options, so many paths to victory.  The [b]Mancala[/b] aspect is genius.  It looks quite daunting, but plays rather smoothly.  Love it.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">+ Being able to manipulate your player board lets you exert control over the rest of your strategy; Plenty of different ways to focus your efforts to win. - Can feel chaotic at time due to not always being able to take your desired action.   Why it's previously-owned: I got burned out on this game playing it dozens of time online.  It began to feel like I had explored all of the strategic depth. This got traded for a bunch of Star Wars: LCG stuff.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Brazil">Great rules, amazing visual.  A lot of things happen in this game!!!! Lot of ways to win. Love it!</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">A strong game by Stefen Feld, who is excellent at making games that I really love for about 5-10 plays.  The Mancala-like action mechanic is very interesting and mind blowing for a few plays.   My second favorite Feld game, after Year of the Dragon (note: I havent yet played Die Burgen, which is rated highly).    I recommend Trajan, but I dont know that I would still be interested in it after playing it 10 times.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Great fun! The wheel, the Trajan tiles, and the extra actions are the heart and soul of this game. The key if finding the right balance. Very well designed and gets better with every play!</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Once you understand the various parts of the board and the mechanisms, it's a very fun game.

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Interesting mancala type game engine.  Lots of critical decisions and actions aren't always immediately available because of the manacala.  Enjoy that the players control the pace of the game and decisions must be weighted against the people's demands.</comment>

It hits a sweet spot, but generally I prefer other felds (aquasphere, bruges, bora bora). FWIW, it was a 9 when I first played it, but I don't think it has a ton of staying power.  my copy: A player's copy, with a split corner on the box that is mended with duct tape. Everything else in good condition.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">2-4(4)  It might be a bit much, actually, but I still enjoyed it. There are a lot of things going on, and they each have a different way in which they operate and give you points. It's a very Feld-ian mishmash of mechanisms, and there are so many ways to score points. Still, managing the rondel is an interesting exercise.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Greece">Great game. Mr Feld has done it again. Its a medium-weight eurogame with a lot of ways to score victory points. You can make short-term as well as long-term plans. The mancala mechanic is awesome. A lot of things going on, so many options. Nice high quality components. The game takes 2-2,5 hours for 4 players but it is not as brain-burning as it seems. kinda like Castles of Burgundy in this aspect. The theme is pasted-on, it's just a cover for this fascinating game engine. </comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Very nice game, feels similar to Castles of Burgundy (my first game by this designer) in that you're collecting a bunch of nuggets. This game is a bit meaner in that you can lose points in a number of ways and there are several sections where a player can be completely locked out. The Mancala thing is incredibly incredibly intricate, but with so much future-decision-making involved that it's hard to really take it into account a lot of the time. I think I like CoB better because it's slightly less fiddly, but both games are excellent (if practically themeless).  EDIT: I lied, I like this more. </comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">My father-in-law recommended RR to me and I bought it tentatively, because it's rather heavy compared to what I normally play. I am fine with heavy games, but my group is not. Still, I decided to give it a whirl. Last Saturday we had only two people show up for game group, so I decided to give 3p Russian Railroads a try.   Loved the game. I'm not ready for the expansion yet (I'm not confident we'll get it played enough to merit that) but definitely am intrigued. I liked my Kiev/Trans-Siberian strategy but would like to try winning by unlocking my extra trains and then focusing entirely on the two shorter railroads. I also know industry is a really valuable track so might try another game where I focus entirely on that as Ashley did this time. </comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">+ Excellent strategy vs. time ratio; The escalating scores really let you see how much progress you're making. - There's only 5 different avenues to shoot for in this one; I suspect that may hurt the replayability in the long run.</comment>

Not that much variable setup though so not sure about the differences between games. But there is certainly quit a few different strategies to try out before that becomes an issue (and I rarely play this kind of game that frequently anyway) and there is always the randomization of Engineer-tiles to mix things up.</comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Greece">Great worker placement game. with simple rules, where players are trying to build a railway network. In reality the are trying to build a VP-generating engine. The game is very well made and seems very balanced. The game works really well despite not having any innovative mechanics. There are some different paths you can explore. I don't know if Russian Railroads has a lot of replayability though. </comment>

    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Canada">I am not a fan of deduction games, but this one is one glorious exception! My rating would be a 10, except for the fact that there will come an inevitable point when the limit of replayability is reached. And that is a gaming tragedy.   COMMENTS ON THE ENGLISH YSTARI EDITION: It's all quite wonderful; yet the font is, at times, challenging to decipher in both the directory and the cases. The most annoying problem, though, is the very poor proofreading job that was done (or not done?) on the text; there are many, many instances of misspellings, and (even worse) situations where isolated French words have never even been translated! This is annoying, but it still does not mar one of the best games ever made.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Norway">I am having to ration myself with this one due to the limited number of cases that come in the game. I have played three cases so far in a group of 4 people and enjoyed them immensely (well, maybe not number 3 so much). I would not want to play it with more than 4 though as there could be the issue of too many brains complicating things.   I just wish Ystari would hurry up and see about publishing the other cases in English!!!</comment>

    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="United Kingdom">Consulting Detective is the more cerebral cousin of those turn to page 234 adventure books; more cerebral in that you have to figure out which page to turn to next for yourself.  The adventures in this package are pretty short and snappy, with Holmes frequently solving them in just a handful of clues.  I tend to take a longer, winding route.  This suggests to me that the level of difficulty is pitched pretty well.    The Holmesian theming is very well done, from the scene setting introduction to each case to the copies of the Times that may contain useful information among reports from the Empire and adverts for snake oil. This was clearly a labour of love by enthusiasts for Conan Doyle's great creation. </comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="United States">This game is a lot of fun, but some of the typos and random leaps of logic are frustrating.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Germany">Not really a common board game but the concept is quite good. It is really hard to solve the cases correctly because some hints are hard to catch.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="United States">This is a fascinating deduction/story game. It sucks you into the story and you really become part of a murder mystery. I was worried that the answers would be too obscure and impossible to find but it actually seems reasonable. During the first case I was never sure how many "leads" I was supposed to have at the end...and it takes a little bit to get a feel for the game since you have to judge whether your line of thought is too simplistic or too complex. Great game!</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Brazil">I have only tried the first case solo so far.  It was a really cool experience. It really immerses you in the Conan Doyle's books atmosphere, and it is for sure a challenging deduction exercise.  However, I just felt close to impossible to figure out the solution following a number of clues that is close to the Sherlock benchmark. Maybe it will become easier if I play it cooperatively with a couple of friends.  Or maybe just forget about the benchmark and play the game competitively.  But it sure needs a playing group that is willing to engage with the format of this unique experience. And willing to read a lot too. </comment>

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="Finland">I have to say that the implementation is nowhere near elegant for a tile laying game. By saying this I am referring to the rule how you must align the tiny little doors on the tiles of varying shape and size. It would not be an issue, if all the tiles had a similar contact surface. However, this is not the case since you have to match, e.g., a circle with a rectangle. Having your tiles just 0.1 mm off can cause a situation where the next tile does not physically fit into to your preferred slot, or vice versa you can pull off illegal moves by shifting the other tiles slightly and squeezing an elephant into a keyhole.  Anyway, the above is maybe the only complaint I have about the game. I enjoyed the theme (which is quite strongly present for an eurogame), the market speculation, and of course the whole aspect of laying tiles and creating combos. Moreover, the market with a limited amount of money in circulation is a nice touch. Variable bonuses and tiles guarantee longevity, I reckon. Art is not great but not bad either. The individually named rooms add flavour to the game. You can almost feel how you are building a castle for a truly mad king.    A small concern for some groups might be the expected brain burn when the starting player sets up the market at the beginning of the round. If you are playing with very tight players who necessarily want to gather and analyse all available information, this phase of the game can become a quite long and frustrating experience. For our group this was not a problem, though.  Castles of Mad King Ludwig has potential to become a classic.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">Ted Alspach's next big game from Bezier game's after his Mensa select hit, "Suburbia". At first blush it can be easy to look at the game's appearance and note the designer and think that it is similar to and should be compared to Suburbia but that would be a mistake. While there are whispers of commonality in some of the mechanics in this game it is a very different animal all together and deserves to be seen as such. Castle's theme is pretty solid and the narrative drive aligns well with play. You are playing the role of a royal ass hat who bankrupted his country building more and more elaborate and sometimes ridiculous castles. I read somewhere that the Disney castle is based on one of his. The reason this aligns with play is that you spend the game drafting rooms and using them to build your own personal castle. Each type of room has a power that triggers when placed next to other rooms in a similar way to the tile placement mechanic in Suburbia. There are of course secret and public objectives which you are building your castle to achieve in order to out score your opponent which adds a little variability to the game. The result is a bunch of crazy looking castles that leave you wanting to kill somebody. If the game has any controversy it would be found in the drafting mechanic which is the primary means of generating revenue. Each turn someone plays the role of master builder. Their job is to arrange the available flop of rooms in order along a draft line with prices in ascending order. The idea is, the builder gets revenue based on what people ultimately pay for drafting a room. So if the builder plays their arrangement well, they effectively balance their need for revenue with their opponents need for rooms while still not giving away what they need to win or what their opponent needs to achieve known game objectives. The problem is, valuation is pretty tricky and if you get it wrong either by missing certain details on the board or not understanding certain player biases beyond your goal than you are broke for an entire round. This... Pretty much costs you the game if you aren't careful. Still, another excellent game by Alspach and proof of his range as a designer. I am glad I own this game and will be keeping it in my collection. It will be interesting to see what he makes next. Hopefully, he'll show some range on components next time as well.</comment>

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">I rather like this one!  The auction part drives everything else, and that's okay.  I like the secret goals.  I like the combo nature of the rooms.  I like the spatial component for placing the rooms and arranging your castle.  It all works very well.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="Canada">A spiritual successor to Suburbia.  It comes with similar tile placement mechanics: certain tiles will interact with other tiles (especially when placed directly beside each other).  The Master Builder sets the price for the available rooms, making it a game of guessing how much your opponents are willing to pay!  Great game.</comment>

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">Enjoyable puzzle tile laying game. A lot of balls in the air with much to keep track of but not overwhelming. Being Master Builder and setting prices can cause AP. </comment>

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">Great tile-laying game. A great alternative to Alhambra if you're looking for something new. The art is great, I liked the scoring mechanics, and the fact that you pay other players for the pieces was great. I really loved that. Was looking forward to playing, and was not disappointed!</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="England">Really enjoyable group game, quite easy to play.   Scoring is a bit tricky, but offset by the beautiful quality of the rooms.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="">Quicker game than expected, but quite a bit of thinking. Also, designing castles is grand fun. I played Suburbia once and enjoyed it, but this removed it from my buy list.  Castle building is just plain fun. The visual elements of the game are satisfying, the Master Builder element is a great interaction tool, and the game requires a surprising amount of thought while not taking too long.  Really wish it had come with an insert though. The game is weirdly aggravating to set-up.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="Spain">Estupendo juego de subastas y colocaci&#243;n de losetas.

Prefiero CMKL sobre este &#250;ltimo, por un reglamento mejorado y sencillo, duraci&#243;n contenida, la estetica y que es accesible para todo el mundo  Como puntos negativos hay que mencionar que requiere de bastante mesa si son mas de 3 jugadores; entre la construcci&#243;n de nuestros castillos, los tableros donde se situan las losetas y el de puntuaci&#243;n.Y tambi&#233;n que la caja trae mucho aire para el precio que tiene.

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="Australia">Nice. I like it.  The game runs out while I am still creating which is frustrating for me personally. But it is what makes it a game and not an open page scrapbooking exercise so we can forgive it.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="England">The comments regarding this game being prone to AP in the Master Builder phase appear to be totally unfounded, regardless of whether you're playing with first timers or not. It's an excellent game with loads to do and insane levels of replayability. It wont replace Suburbia for me but I suspect it might even be a better game. It's certainly much more beautiful than its cousin.</comment>

    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">I honestly enjoy this game a lot.  However, there's mechanic and balance issues depending on how many Hero characters are in play.  I think the game plays better with three or more of them.  With two, one wrong move and its either an easy win, or the Overlord can just mop the floor.  On the whole, a great game that I've managed to bring many non-gamers into.  Lots of fun!</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">I've always liked Descent and thought that Descent 2 would be easier to get to the table with the shorter missions.  That didn't happen because the streamlining which made the game shorter actually ended up making the game less appealing to my son.  Anyway with the app's release I can play the game solo as well as introduce some Descent goodness to my younger son.  Glad to finally dust this game off and play!</comment>

    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="">Descent is one of the best miniature games I have ever played, where a group of players can band up against the Overlord player which can control some cool creatures like dragons etc. The theme is great, the miniatures are AWESOME and the fact that you have different scenarios, different skills to choose from, different items, different characters, different Overlord cards etc. offers you a great deal of variety. Your characters do not have a lot of health, and a decent hit could consume half of your hit points in in an instance. This creates tension, you never know you will live the next turn (well technically, you don't die but are just knocked down). However, this brings along that combat can feel really swingy at times, and also too luck-based. One turn you are winning without question, the other you feel like crying and giving up. Although I like games where there is some mechanism to deal with a runaway leader problem, I think they overdid it with this one. Another problem is the set-up, which can take a long time. The disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages, but I can imagine people put off be this. Still a wonderful game!

    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United Kingdom">Certainly more competitive than expected. The overlord role is demoralizing to play when crushed by the heroes.  The shop and traveling stages between the quests are great but somewhat lacking in length. It would be nice to have a little more moments for the hero characters to be involved in other incidents outside of the incredibly competitive quests.  The game plays incredibly well and is overall quite balanced. </comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">From a design standpoint, it's simply breathtaking how faithful this is to the War of the Ring story.  Any one who's looked at the fiction of the War of the Ring can appreciate just how non-linear it is -- in fact, this is what made me eventually realize just how more universal the Ring trilogy is than Star Wars could ever hope to be.    Everything is here, the brutal grind of the armies flung at one another juxtaposed with the vital quest to render the ring.  And the game itself, in the 2nd edition is just fantastically, lovingly produced;  you can simply feel the positive energy that went into its creation knowing the design itself was already proven and successful.  Still, I have to say this game didn't entirely work for us, and least not in the sense that we want to play it alot.  This is a bleep-we're-snowed-in-for-36-hours kind of game -- not the kind of game you want to impulsively play again immediately after finishing.  The quest of the ring is exhausting for all, the stakes so high, that it makes no sense to trifle with it strictly for diversion.   This is a game you must be prepared to live....</comment>

    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="United States">A medieval shouting match best reserved for 8+ players.  Avalon can work with gamers and non-gamers alike but will deflate without charismatic player participation. I recommend finding a group it works with then sticking with them.  A handful of interesting player powers and the quick-ish play time make Avalon a game that will get multiple plays before closing the box for the night. One of the best social deduction games out there.</comment>
    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="United Kingdom">The Resistance is a game modeled on Werewolf but with more information on which to base your deduction, no player elimination, and no need for a GM.  Which is all  good in my book. Avalon adds the Merlin character, who operates like the Seer and makes this version even more Werewolfy.  I have found both versions of The Resistance somewhat fragile.  If luck gifts one side an early advantage, it can be over quickly and unsatisfactorily.  On the other hand, it frequently delivers as concentrated a shot of bluff, deduction, paranoia and double-think as you can reasonably expect of a thirty-minute filler.  I rather liked the futuristic resistance cell setting of the original and this Arthurian re-theming makes somewhat less sense.  The art and production are both good.  The rules are clear enough.</comment>

    <comment game="Crokinole" game_id="521" location="Latvia">Everyone loves this game! I splurged and got a tournament style board from Mr. Crokinole. It looks great hanging on the wall, and plays even better!</comment>
    <comment game="Crokinole" game_id="521" location="United States">150909 It might have lost a little luster due to Carrom but right now neither game is getting much run.  This one however stays stronger in my mind's eye.  120910 Well it dropped to a 9.  Weird how finding another great game (Carrom) might lower your rating.  I'll have to think about how this all works.  Damn.  110604 All its cracked up to be!  If I wasn't semi-nomadic we'd pick one up right now!  Finally got a set and I love it!</comment>
    <comment game="Crokinole" game_id="521" location="Australia">Great fun. Pretty quick, plays well in partnerships, quite tactical, much more portable and storeable than a billiards table!</comment>

    <comment game="Crokinole" game_id="521" location="Finland">Crokinole, man! It's so much fun!   I had been wondering about this game for years. Why does a 'flick your finger' linger in amongst the top games in BGG year after year? But I wonder no more. Yes, the basic premise is very simple but the beef is hidden in the rules. You really have to ponder about the choices and while it is possible for a player to make epic comebacks no matter how dire the situation on the score board or on the table looks like.  The scoring is a bit on the abstract side and it is not always easy to see who is winning the round. This can slow you down at first if you played very seriously. However, most of the time it is quite intuitive to see what you need to do and you do not have to worry too much about the scoring.  I definitely recommend Crokinole to everyone and I am happy to play it any time.</comment>
    <comment game="Crokinole" game_id="521" location="United States">If flicking games were the Greek Gods than Crokinole would be Zeus, father of them all. You flick wooden discs across a varnished round board trying to pip the ace and get them in a small circular goal while also knocking your opponents discs out of the way or off the board. It is great fun and I am always happy to play. I actually payed to have a custome LOTR board that I have been dying to play with at some point...</comment>
    <comment game="Crokinole" game_id="521" location="United States">Finally learned how to play this at BGG Con 2014, and really enjoyed it. Grabbed one of the Mayday ding and dent copies, and it's got a tiny blemish on one edge, probably not enough to affect play. Will need a few more plays before rating, but can definitely see the appeal!</comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United Kingdom">Rating based on 2 plays. Game seemed impenetrable from reading the rules.  Sort of clicked in the second round and seems like a great game.  I really like how the dice rolling is incorporated, plus the secret roles, the random trader cards giving game variety and the way the attacks on the city come in.  Lots to like.  Brain-burning. First game took us 4 hours.  Second game, 2 players. Still felt brain-burning. But worked well as a two player. I'm starting to wonder if it is too heavy for me.  Mainly because it feels like there are too many choices/options each turn.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="England">One of the best of the year. Another innovative use of dice and the fact that the cards available are different each game means great variety and a different approach required each time</comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">Really good strategy game with a good randomization factor in the dice. I am a big fan of this sort of random strategy game. I am also a big fan of competitive games that take a co-op aspect to need to fight an AI enemy while still needing to defeat each other.  The only negative to this game is not a lot of other people will enjoy it. This makes accessibility hard to bring to the table all the time.   I play this on boardgamearena.com .  BGA</comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">130929 I like the game, but its a bit fiddly. I find teaching the game kind of annoying cause you do need to cover a lot of ground.  I typically like elegant games which this is not, but still its currently a guilty pleasure.  110706 Light enough for me to really enjoy but meaty enough to hold my interest.  I think this will be a keeper for a while.  Maybe not top of top of the line, but great game non the less (and its the only worker placement game I have...well I guess I have 'gric).  And very nice consistent clean art.  Really, really like this game.  Unfortunately I expect this to peak and then dip eventually...but until then I'm bumping it to a 9.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United Kingdom">There is dice rolling though not too much luck. Very clever game and what seems like a tonne of re-playability due to the limited number of cards per game and the various ways they will all interact in combination. Great blind victory conditions to be figured out from your opponents moves. Top gamer's game and look forward to playing again. Decent addition to the collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="Wales">Long rules explanation and initially unintuitive gameplay present a barrier to newcomers - this is a game you have to work at, if you are going to get to grips with it. But it's worth it. The decisions involved are deep. Interaction can stifle your plans but there is always an alternate strategy you can employ. The artwork is excellent and the use of dice is very cleverly integrated. A great game.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="Poland">2016-06-23 (rating 8):  Still played it only a few times. But seems much more interesting than [gameid=84876] and much more interactive.</comment>
    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">A fascinating game with a wide variety of set ups which makes for very likely a different strategy each time. The dice mechanic here is quite unique although a touch clunky in the calculations for buying dice. Also this one is very prone to analysis paralysis since each of your dice can be taken and opportunities closed off. Yet a game that sticks with you - challenging and engaging. I like it!</comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="England">Recreates the feel of the book superbly, taking Diplomacy into a modern gaming age by adding some very slick "german" mechanisms.

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="United States">Really solid skeleton of mechanics. I think that the system is cool. But the experience is marred a bit by just how nasty and sharp the player interaction is. It's a very good game, but I don't love how you have to play.   I suppose this fits the theme well in the backstabbing, high stakes sense. Minus how much more powerful I think the houses should actually feel in battle (combat resolution is not so thematic). And it is a bit weird that you can hold "the iron throne" without holding King's Landing... actually, everything about the power tokens is thematically very odd.</comment>

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">1st play: Uwe's missing link between Agricola/Le Havre and newer games like Glass Road and Caverna.  The system is a bit rougher here and there are an absurd amount of resource types to convert. The theme and presentation is solid and there is a ton of variety. Huge puzzle to decode, and with no people to struggle to feed you can focus on the wide open victory paths.  2nd play: I really enjoyed the 2nd play of this.  I started making harder resources (whiskey) and using other people's buildings a bit. I could see needing a few plays to really learn the buildings. The wheel makes between round upkeep a breeze, and is a stark contrast to the caver and refill phase. Glad I acquired this one, too bad there probably won't ever be an expansion for it. </comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Similar to Le Havre, but without having a dominant strategy like Le Havre does which makes the game too one dimensional.  I think of it as a superior version of Le Havre.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Spain">A Le Havre evolution. More complex and better than original.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Cool design with lots of interesting decisions for building up your territory for points and special actions. The resource wheel is neat and offers a unique and useful method of gauging resource availability over time.  One of the most annoying pitfalls is the poorly produced physical components (thin and cheap). The player aid is especially crucial to the design with its spreadsheet of necessary strategic information--but the graphic design is a mess. It looks like a huge excel spreadsheet with tiny font on a cheap piece of paper. I would easily rate OeL a bit higher if they could manage to produce it with reasonable quality.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Spain">Otro gran juego del auto de Le Havre y Agricola.

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Canada">This game would be a 10 and maybe even top Agricola in the list of Uwe's big hits if it wasn't for the very scripted feel of each match.  This game begs for some kind of starting variables or mid-game mix ups.  We've tried a few variants but none are quite right.  It actually makes me mad because otherwise this is just an amazing game.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">High 8.  Current gaming group favorite.  There's something about being able to fiddle with so many different kinds of resources that appears to us.  (And yet I have no desire to play Le Havre.  I'm weird.)</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Sweden">Good economics game. The roundel mechanic really adds to the fun of the game. Will you harvest the resource you need for its current value or will you wait for it to become worth more but then risk someone else harvesting it instead? </comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Portugal">I'm interested. I'll wait for someone to buy it and see if this is on the same group as Uwe's last two turds or not.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Agricola has randomness in the distribution of occupation cards and minor improvements. This game does not have that randomness but has a seemingly endless possibility for combinations and strategy. Love it. The fact that it has a monastic theme is a bonus, with subtle humour added to thematic elements. </comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Another great design from Rosenberg, I love the theme of monks building up their diocese, the rondel for resources and upgrades works well to open the game up, and the actions are simple yet conceal a lot of depth. Assembling your player's region is fun with the additional boards, and the whole thing has a sense of elegance about it. The only issue is reversing those rondel dials for different player counts with an actual screwdriver, but that's minor and I'd advise when you open your box to place them both on the player count sides you'll most often use. Box includes both Irish and French play variants, so you can get a lot of longevity out of this edition.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Belgium">First impression was very positive, unlike the last couple of games from Uwe Rosenberg: good theme, interesting buildings, a good innovation in the product wheel, multiple and varied paths to play through the game, and it flowed pretty well (under two and a half hours for a first play with three, one a newbie and the other two inexperienced). In part it still featured the typical pressure on food through the settlements, but in a much more positive and subtle way; you can really play the game for fun, without the stress you're under in Agricola and Le Havre. I'm curious to see how it plays with two, and I have the feeling I'll end up preferring this over Le Havre.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Another winner, though it still gives me a headache.  Probably will until I am more familiar with all the buildings.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">Very good worker placement game. The addition of dice in the game puts a new spin on the classic eurogame mechanic. However, even if dice aren't your friend give it a try, the tools allow you to mitigate bad rolls somewhat.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United Kingdom">An enjoyable game although always hesitant of the dice element as getting lucky can provide a signficant advantage. Obviously can mitigate the luck to some extent with additional workers/tools but still a factor.</comment>
    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United Kingdom">excellent idea and execution</comment>
    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">A great introductory worker placement game.  Not as "pure" as others due to resource collection being governed by dice rolls, but have only played a couple of games where the probabilities swung wildly in favor of or against a player so the random element here isn't necessarily a killer.  </comment>
    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">From the Reviews: This just did not capture me. I don't mind dice games but when the game relies so heavily on it I tend to shy away from that. Plus the theme seems not cool, but I am willing to try it with a fresh mind to see how it is ... Well after playing it I do enjoy the way the dice work out. Next time though I will buy more cards though. This is a fun game</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">Probably my most played worker placement game.  Caverna is better, but its so much more of an undertaking that Stone Age just hits the table more.  SA is just simple enough that you can play it with people that are intimidated by Rosenberg-level complexity, but it has enough depth that I don't feel I'm playing a watered-down worker placement game.  Love the way the dice mechanic allows for random "Woo!" and "Argh!" table moments but gives players lots of control over how big of risks they'd like to take.</comment>
    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United States">Excellent light game, With a nice system to obtain and manage resources.  The score could be brutal at the end if you overlook the extra bonuses.  My family really enjoyed this game</comment>

    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="United States">Great "dungeon crawler". Love the fact that no one has to play the monsters, everyone are the heroes.  Amazing miniature sculpts.</comment>
    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="United States">1st play: First play with Wife, 9 and 7 yr old. The 9 year old really liked it, she had fun picking her guild and the fact that there were girl heroes to choose from was a big selling point for her. I really liked the art style and tongue-in-cheek delivery of the characters and plot line.  The game is dead simple, and I'll be interested to see how well the game goes over with gamers.  2nd play: Probably the best dudes on a map, dungeon crawly game I have played.  The action is fast, the exploding dice are excellent, and the PvE objectives are hard.  When you complete them it feels like an accomplishment.  Each mission completed allows you to strengthen and grow your heroes without allowing the winner to run away with the game.  I wish the minis were painted already, I may have to try my hand.</comment>

    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="Canada">Initial Impression: This is my first experience with a CMON game and I'm pleasantly surprised. The components are of the same quality as FFG with thick cardboard tokens and nice quality cardstock. The minis are incredibly detailed and look fun to paint. This game is a fun tactical minis game with emphasis on "fun". The rules are light and can be absorbed in minutes. The characters each have interesting powers and mixing and matching will lead to some interesting decisions. Overall the game has a "videogame" feel to it, as your team runs around popping the mobs and other players in a frantic race to collect gold and complete your quests. I'm very impressed with the game as it was more fun than I had originally expected.</comment>

    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="">Pfister is climbing up my favorite designer charts.  Mombassa is richly complex.  I find it a thematic representation of colonial business, but others disagree.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Malaysia">It has unique theme that caught my attention, stock market with familiar Euro mechanics, a bit of deckbuilding (Concordia-like), worker placement (you have 2. Some special actions spaces, majority goods/travelers spaces &amp; buying extra action tile for next round), area control where you spend travelling points to build trading posts on the map with bonuses &amp; open up the coin spaces of each companies to be multiplied with each score tracks (multiplier like in Orleans) &amp; unlock special ability, fulfill requirements to advance on bookkeeping track &amp; use diamond merchants to advance on diamond track, the last 2 tracks can unlock 2 more card spaces to play each round. Most points win. What's very unique about Mombasa is that the companies are not tied to any player, every player can have shares &amp; expand any of the companies, the red/orange/white/black buildings are not attached to any player. It feels almost like a semi-coop game and I kinda like it. The player aid is very useful. This is a confirmed 3-hours game with full quorom of 4 players.   Part area control, part deckbuilding, intertwined mechanisms that make the game tight &amp; engaging. The rules a bit restrictive but the action phase is actually easy with only 5 options to choose from and limited by the cards in your slots. Very good Euro game for any player counts (2/3/4)   </comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Rock solid medium weight Euro that will stretch your mind with smart card play that needs to be well managed through a series of discard piles and draw backs. It gives the game a punch that sets it far apart. The rest of the trappings are things seen before - a bit of light deck building, some area control, bonus tiles if you're very nice, and the like. Extremely well produced and definitely a polished game. Enjoyed it very much.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Turkey">A very good game, but I'd say one useless layer of complexity than it was necessary. Very deep tactically. Hard to find the right group to play it, not for ever group.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Netherlands">Great tactical game, but not really the team. Love the way how you have to regenerate your cards.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Spain">Liked it a LOT! Probably one of the best games published on Essen '15. The mechanics of the card stacks is fresh and put your brains to work. Great game. </comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Portugal">Fantastic eurogame. For me, this should placed alongside the best euro's in the market (plus, it costs less than 35eur).</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Canada">Seems like it would play better with more than 2 players as it would encourage more competition. That said, it still works well enough with 2-player to remain interesting. Card selection can be difficult at times as you wrestle with trying to out-maneuver your opponent, get what you want, and try to consider what cards you have left, where they'll be discarded, and which stack you'll be reclaiming.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Leading off with a super-solid 8 after a single 3P play. Setup for new players was prohibitively discouraging, but we could all tell from the rules that there was something good. Closest analog for me would probably be Russian Railroads: many paths, initially opaque, missing its mechanic theme (share-holding). I liked RR, and seem to love this. Obvious potential for AP and botches with the multi-turn planning. Looking very forward to more plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Germany">Great interaction and smart mechanics meet a completely stuping theme, doing nothing but further building the clichee of Euro theme blandness. This game even goes a step further and pretends the ugly side of African colonialisation never existed in the game's "fictional" scenario. Yeah, right!  This would be a 9 or a 10 otherwise. :(</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="England">After a long two hour read through comprehensive rules set, started to play.  Both opponents AP prone and the game took over three hours.  Much too long.  The game was cleverly put together.  The card drafting from the board is the latest development of the payment mechanic first introduced in Dirk Henn's Show Manager.  The shifting of the map ownership by the four powers worked much better than I expected, being quite fluid, but not too painful as the double city coin fields could not be overwritten.  The coins giving value to the cities.  The board and the cities had some similarities to the corals in Reef Encounter.  The card hand management was clever and inspired as were the increase in hand limit mechanism.  I bought little so on the least couple of rounds failed to fill my five slots.  But all the systems seemed fine tuned and well balanced.  Even my promotion to 8 shares in the explorer section only yielded an extra point when weighing up the alternatives.  There seems plenty to explore about the game, which I hope to do with less AP prone opponents.</comment>

    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Greece">A nice game but a bit overly complex for no apparent gameplay reason. Perhaps there is more depth than I could see at the first play.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Italy">One of the best eurogames released in 2015. A medium-heavy game with a great deal of interaction, playing in a reasonable amount of time, is a rare gem: Mombasa delivers on many levels with a great story arc, shared incentives and the need to plan no matter what you do.  There is a lot of stuff going on: players take actions mixing (simultaneous secret) card programming and worker placement, aiming at stock acquisition in companies but also trying to improve their personal boards (to unlock additional card slots and score points).  Alexander Pfister scores another hit after Broom Service. It's a designer I will be watching closely.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Australia">Some very interesting twist on mechanics - books that have requirements but can be skipped in groups, action spaces that need showing majorities, limited cards you can get back each turn, variable share tracks that increase in value through expansion, buying new cards only with the same kind of good.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United Kingdom">A big game that doesn't get played too often. I like how all the different areas work together but it is pretty long!</comment>

    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Romania">Fun, but a little to heavy for me. Analysis paralysis in a box. I felt exhausted after I played this. The good thing is, it really took just 2 hours for the first play in 2 players. </comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Denmark">Euro mechanism mecca. They throw everything but the kitchen sink at this game and it somehow works really well. There's worker placement, there's a sort of deck building, there are stock tracks, there's a sort of area control thing as well. Very solid game that is unlikely to disappoint a fan of mid- to midheavy euros.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">I had tempered expectations for Mombasa and I will need more plays. The stock manipulation aspect of the game seems to work and I like the planning and build up. Still, it also feels like there may be a bit too much swing and king-making late in the game within the territories of Africa.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Initial Impressions: ---------------------- All of Alexander Pfister's games have been good so far, but this is his masterpiece (so far).  What a neat take on a stock game, with a really cool hand management mechanism.  Is this the best Euro game from 2015?  It could be...</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">July 2016 - I have played this four times now and enjoy the heck out of it.  Everything matters, how you place your cards, what you do and the timing that goes with it.  It all ties together very well and there is a bit of theme here, too.  I'm now of the belief that you really need to see how the game is going to get your points.  Long term mixed with short term but a mixed bag of gaining points is the way to go (and you can do that in a variety of ways, leading to the creativity I like in a game).  This game pleases me.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Belgium">nice card mechanism, 7 rounds just too short ??? Only 2 plays so far</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Denmark">I passed on this game at Essen, but wanted to play it. I couldn't ever find a spot at a demo table but I am still eager to at least try it.   Update: I ended up getting this game in a trade. It is a really fun and interesting game. On one hand, it is just a bunch of Euro mechanics stuffed together, but on the other hand it has several unique twists. The card play and discard mechanism is great and leads to meaty timing decisions. The timing of the worker placement, card buying, and expansion really adds tension as well. Finally, I really enjoyed the "light" stock element. It made the company expansion area majority game much more tolerable because players are free to cross invest. I also really liked the fact that I could buy cards with shares. This reminded me of Concordia and added some mystery to end game scoring.  Overall a really enjoyable game. I'm glad I picked this one up as a medium heavy game.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Sleeved Custom deckbox  // Almost but not quite point salad. There are several elements going on at the same time--area control, worker placement, drafting, hand management--but each one is  light enough and integrates well enough with the rest of  the game that it feels like it all fits together into a  pretty tight package. I'd rate this as my favorite  economic game (a category I don't have a ton of games in, but still).</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Portugal">Mind blowing game!  It seems very complicated, but in the 2nd turn of the game you'll be like "oooh, that's the way it works!!! Oh I get it now".... and from then on, the game speed increases a lot.  This game doesn't innovate with new mechanics, but you'll feel that you're being presented to something that you've never have seen before. That's because it mixes a lot of clever mechanics, all of them inter-related... and at the end, everything makes sense (mechanics wise).  So many different strategies, so many hard decisions. A challenging game, that has a big learning curve (at least, if you want to play it well).  The theme seems dry, but you'll focus on the mechanics rather than the theme itself.   This is a lock! A game to play and to keep!</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Poland">A fun game, which is easy to play and hard to master. A lot of things need to be taken into consideration every turn and even every move. Player interaction is just right - you can benefit from moves of other people and also have to watch what actions they want to take in the future.</comment>

There is no better game than this one.   The vast array of upgrades should eliminate any concerns about replayability. What a fun game.   The only knock against would be the initially overwhelming amount of upgrade tiles. Doesn't take long to figure them out though, so not a huge deal. </comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Austria">I was very excited when I bought this game. I liked so many things about it: its light war-game nature, the Egyptian mythology theme, the tech-tree that allows you to personalize your faction, the giant monsters following you in battle. Then I played it a few time and the game left me with the strange feeling of a shallow game-play. I felt like every play would be the same, as during the first few turns everyone buys up technologies just to then start teleporting all over the place, targeting the weakest spot to get easy points and conquering temples. It was terribly monotonous.  That made me sad. I hated the teleporting rule and even more the huge impact of the turn order on the entire thing. I never really disliked the game, but I thought it wasn't designed well enough. So I played it a few times, rated it a 5, sold my copy and forgot about it. Almost two years later, I had the opportunity to play it again and I wanted to give it another chance. So it happened that I changed my mind, at least a little bit.  While I still don't love this game as much as many others  here on BGG do, I had a lot of fun. I enjoyed the challenge that the game was able to provide me, the tension and the need to time your actions perfectly to get what you want. I liked to build combos with the technology tiles and personalize my strategy. At the same time though I still think that the teleporting rule is stupid and that the turn order is too relevant. I also still think that every game will start exactly the same with players buying technology tiles as much as possible. And I have another complaint, that only I seem to have with Kemet: while in general the artwork is really well done, I don't like how the board looks like and that definitively lowers my enjoyment of the game and consequently my rating.  Therefore, after so many twists and turns in my opinions, I must say that I enjoy Kemet quite a bit, but I would enjoy it more if the game would have been a little different in some of its aspects. At least though I now understand why people like it so much, even if I don't necessarily agree on everything. Kemet is a pretty good game. I like it!</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Spain">Total confrontation game in which tactics surpas strategy. It does this really well preventing some of the problems commonly associated with this type of games. I like it and I would like to play it more often, but it seems that I am the only one in my gaming group with this positive opinion.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - each player deploys the troops of an Egyptian tribe and uses the mystical powers of the gods of ancient Egypt &#8211; along with their powerful armies &#8211; to score points in glorious battles or through invasion of rich territories. A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers. It is a fast paced strategy/wargame, where the emphasis is on direct combat. Building up the defenses will only make you lose. The artwork is great, the rules easy to grasp and it doesn`t take ages to play as similar games do.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">I like the art design of the map, I like the way the game encourages attacking and the distances are all balanced. I like the game feels very fast and cool special powers.   The huge variety of power cards to reference and look up is a lot of work. I think if I played this a lot I would like it better than a 7 but with the frequency I'll end up playing it, the variety of powers slows the game down more than I'd like.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Canada">So incredibly fun.  Great tactical choices to be made, and less turtling than other similar games!  Miniatures are great and well detailed.  There is no better time to be had with scarab beetles.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">There's a small feast of options to make Kemet an asynchronous tactical slugfest. Teching up is fun. Combat is bloody and fast.   Unfortunately, the balance is a tiny bit wonky. I vastly prefer the 10 point game to the 8 point game. But those two points also significantly extend the length of the game. Kemet would be firing on all gears if it nailed the balance between ideal length and strategy.  Kemet is a very good option for a hybrid Euro-Thematic knife fight. The wonky balance of length and choices holds it back the most for me.</comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Greece">Good area control game. Great production values, similar to Cyclades. Easy to teach and play. I like the simple combat system with minor bluffing elements, reminds me of Game of Thrones. The games flows quickly and promotes attacking. A lot of gods powers to choose from. You can build your own combos. Kemet is bloody fun and it takes around 1 to 2 hours depending the number of players. </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United Kingdom">A multiplayer fantasy wargame done right-- fun, self-balancing, nice production values, a good playing time. Really like it and want to play more.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="">Pros: - Amazing Quality &amp; Beautiful Miniatures - Feels Bad Ass to command the Legendary Creatures. - Extremely fast playing (90 minutes or less!)area control game that rewards attacking &amp; discourages turtling (you will lose if you try to turtle). - Great Card Combat Mechanics make for exciting diceless battles. - Prayer Resource &amp; Action Management felt appropriate and well developed.  Cons: - Perhaps too many Power Tile upgrades for your faction, could benefit from fewer choices to speed play and make tiles more equally beneficial. - Has a bit of a problem with Kingmaking towards end, as players can attack weakened armies after they get out of a battle for cheap easy VPs. Rewards reactionary/opportunistic game play to a fault. - Some Power Tile Upgrades are far better than others (extra actions, teleports, cost reductions) - Rulebook requires 2-3 read through, you can miss a few things. Like you cannot have 2 power tiles of the same name, no matter what, not even of different colors. (we played wrong for a bit)  Plays best with 4-5 players.  Player who makes best tile purchases, wins most battles, and manages their actions best wins!</comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Turkey">Kemet is a great looking thematic game filled with many strategical and tactical decisions in every moment within the game. Can't wait for the expansion to be released, although I still have to play the core game more.  Playing music from Pharaoh and Children of the Nile soundtracks greatly enhance the atmosphere and I recommend it.  The two things putting Kemet off from a 9+ rating are king-making issues and the rulebook skipping so many exceptional cases.  Rating 8 -&gt; 8.5 after 6 plays.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">I demoed this one night as we went through the rules, and was kind of "meh" on it after a lot of initial excitement. But my wife was really excited to play it. I have to say that the Rahdo walkthrough videos are a godsend! I read through the rules again by myself and watched his videos, and was able to easily teach the game by ourselves. It is a great game, though a little cut-throat with only 2 players. We may have to house rule a few things to allow us to live in the same house afterwards.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Canada">Finally got this one to the table. Really interesting deduction game. I definitely need a couple more plays (and a better read through of the rules) for things to fall into place. First impressions: I like it and can see it growing on me.  Second game (upgraded to a 8 from 7.5): oops - I managed to flip a sign when putting it into the board which screwed up my deductions :P Was still a ton of fun and plays really quickly. I like the app integration with this one. It works really well.  Note: Have yet to try the master variant. Also, we've been playing 2 player. Will attempt to introduce to friends this weekend.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">Provisional 8 after one play. There is a lot going on here, and while picking up a new game usually comes very easy to me, I know this one needs additional plays before I can really give a fair review. I won with like 39 points (39-38-36 final score in a 3 way game) and we all made a TON of mistakes, including forgetting to score the high number of seals a couple of end rounds, and lots of just suboptimal plays. That being said, I really can't wait to play it again and I'm glad it's on the 10x10.  later: multiple plays, still quite good. Early publishing is important but risky. I've lost games from an incorrect hedging. I need to play more often to see if a metagame evolves.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">Fantastic deduction/puzzle game, but it's kind of a race to publish.   I'm not the best at it, since I always mix up my deduction notes, but it's fascinating and addictingly fun to play.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="Estonia">A very solid game with minimal luck and a lot of intense thinking and a good amount of possible action choices. I really like how it is possible to try out a potion with a student's help or drink it yourself and be wary of some possible not very pleasant effects. Selling potions is also a good move, but publishing your theory is so realistically done, you really feel being an academic in university. Also the artwork is amazing and at some point "harry-potterish".</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">A clever game of mixing potions, deducing the alchemical properties of the ingredients, selling said potions to adventurers, publishing your theories, and then scoring at conferences and a final round exhibition. The mechanisms for player order and placing action cubes are nifty, and the app works rather well for the potions once you wrap your head around the idea. Excellent, colorful artwork, good components (including elaborate player screens with their own deduction boards), and the rules have a little of that CGE sense of humor you'll recall from Dungeon Petz, etc. I do feel the game is already substantial enough without the Master Variant for debunking theories, but otherwise it's pretty damn good and the variation of ingredient properties with the app gives it hefty replay value.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United Kingdom">Initial rating after one play. Great thematic fun. Not sure how much of a game there is. We played where one player became an alien. The alien cards were ridiculously powerful and tore the rest of us apart. But we did get to the last objective and see it. But then died.  Second game. Much more of a game. Played the same scenario so we knew what was coming. As a result felt less thematic and less fun. I'm kern to play the other scenarios, but some if the others thought it was too long.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">I like it better than Marvel Legendary, which I like quite a bit, because it's a better pure coop.  It's more difficult (though not by a lot from my limited experience), there are no points to earn and no single winner.  The Coordinate keyword adds far more cooperation to the game and takes away the feeling of being multiplayer solitaire (which I normally like, but is not a good thing for a coop), and I think makes it scale better with more players since you have more opportunities to play Coordinate cards.  My only complaint is that some of the images are a bit too gory for my taste.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Canada">I could give this game a ten!  But I so dislike games with player elimination.  That aside, this game is so very good.</comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Marvel Legendary sounded pretty lame when I heard about it, but something about the Encounters:Alien stuff just seemed to take a luke-warm idea up to something that might just sizzle.  Turns out that was the case.  I picked this up on a lark and was surprised at how engrossing this co-op deck builder can be.  Plus it is difficult!    I still have aspects of the game to explore (like hidden agendas and a mission set-up beyond "The Nostromo") but so far this game is a bona fide hit that really evokes the feeling of the source material.  A side note:  I'm not a fan of the comic-book style art on the cards and there is much about the layout that could have been changed for the sake of clarity and gameplay.  That said it's not enough to take away from what really is a great time!</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="France">Although I am a superhero fan more that an aliens fan, I cannot but accept the superiority of this game. The theme invoked is realised in a way more concise and fulfilling  way than in the Marvel deckbuilder, I so much prefer the mat vs the board, even though the iconography could potentially be made in a better, more  clear way. But this is just nitpicking. I so dig this game!</comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">The theme here is spot on, which really boosts my opinion of the game itself. That said, the game is tough and often bleak, yet a lot of fun both as multiplayer and solo. There are some actions the cards do that you can't utilize in solo mode, which is a bit of a bummer, but otherwise I think this game is solid. </comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">One of the best co-op deck building games available.  Great tension and the need to play cooperatively in order to succeed makes the game a blast to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Canada">Initial Impression: This game is drips theme. From the moment the first card is revealed to the time that you're consumed, the game builds up tension akin to the movies up which they're based. This game forces cooperative play among the players (victims) from the get-go in order to survive as a team. I need to play more of this game.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Canada">Wow.  Just wow.   Can be a hard game, but the deckbuilding and coordinate ability are so cool.  Can't beat the theme on this one</comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">A better game than Marvel Legendary with a very cool story setup.

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Germany">Great thematic deck builder bit the swing of difficulty bothers me.

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United Kingdom">Great light cooperative deck builder. Really enjoyable onset of mechanics through the scenarios and really makes good use of the theme. This game only suffers in replay value for once each 'movie' is completed you can sort of work out the best tactic. Yes you can mix and match the sub scenarios, though I believe most people won't see this as an attractive feature. </comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">6 plays / 3,4,5 players LIKE: The player's tableau is where the meat of strategy is, allocating properly and keeping spots flexible. Many paths to win. Interesting ways to adjust the game for playing abilities and length. War and bad events give you enough time to react. Competing for the cards added good tension. plays smooth.  DISLIKE: long game (4p=3.5 to 4 hr). The randomness of cards can be streaky and deny a card you need. Can be a punishing game, frustrating players.  OVERALL: A nation management game, reacting to events. Subtle strategies, but a lot of thinking and hard decisions. Perfect amount of player interaction. The randomness of cards is not terrible, but it can mess up your goals. i wish the game was shorter, but this could be adjusted. The game gets better the more it is played.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">It's obvious why this is a darling: a zillion cards of which you'll typically see only a fraction in any given play. The simplicity of the actions belies the complexity of interactions between players. There is the limited pool of cards for purchase, but also the conflict in military values, stability and 'books' is very good between players. It does take some time to complete, but there is an anxious fun in seeing the next set of available progress cards. And oh the tension in keeping your civilization viable by balancing all resources needed! Everything runs lean - delightful!  EDIT: After several more plays, I'm having trouble finding any fault with this game. I love it! I'm also finding the 'B' side of civs to be curiously *easier* to play than the 'A' side.  EDIT: More plays in. The game is wearing a bit now. I still find it really good, but I've explored most of what it has to offer. Scoring high is a matter of tactics - taking advantage of opportunities presented - and little more than that. It remains tense to be sure!</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Fantastic civ-building game.  It's got a very Euro-y feel, but captures the theme pretty well.  It's a relatively straight-forward game with a fair helping of luck, but seems deep enough and strategic enough to be worth the long play time.  Having only played twice and not having used any of the "advanced" cards, I do feel like most of the cards are just slight variations on each other, but my hope is that the advanced cards will spice things up.  Plus, giving each card widely differing powers might send AP through the roof.  In my plays so far, AP has not been much of a problem and turns tend to go pretty quickly for the most part.  This is a game I feel has a lot of promise and I look forward to playing it more.</comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Singapore">An excellent worker placement game. Lots of thematic flavor.   The multitude of cards meant that, no 2 games will play the same. Though it may seem that there are lots of options in each and every turn, but it's not. It's up to the player to decide how he/she would like to bring his nation towards which victory pathway. From that decision, to formulate your play/plan towards that goal.  Significant player interaction in War especially, so players  can't concentrate on their own options only and forgo some sacrifices..  Overall, a cut above Lords Waterdeep and such similar worker placement type game. Highly replayable.</comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Nations is a neat civ themed game. Although, mechanically, I don't think the gameplay really drives home the civ theme. The central board tracks stability, military strength, wars, and various random events. So that's all very civilization-y. But Nations is primarily a tableau building euro game with emphasis on worker allocation and gathering/managing resources. The main and plain of the gameplay is purchasing cards that come out onto the public market which gets filled up twice per age.  Unfortunately, the pacing of the game can be very strange since the things that come out on the market are randomly drawn and you might not see very many cards for the things that you *should* be seeing a lot of, statistically, and vice versa. The events are also pretty random and can be brutal. On the other hand, this randomness enhances replayability and the narrative of each game session.   I also wish that there were more starting civs as well. The included nations are cool, but extremely limited (there are so few). Regardless, it's a very good game.</comment>

The comparisons to Through the Ages are inevitable. Nations is faster and lighter without loosing much of his bigger 'brother'. Still TtA is more strategic since all cards will eventually show up, while Nations is more tactical since you have to adopt to what cards are on offer each turn.</comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Poland">Preliminary rating after one play. It seems like a more euroish version of TtA and even though generally I don't like eurogames I think I actually like this one more than TtA, mostly because it avoids some of the problems that I find in TtA: long downtimes and too much emphasis on military. The fact that not all the cards come into play each time may not be a bad thing too, coz TtA oftentimes feels too scripted with the same cards coming each game.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Italy">[First Impressions] It really seems to be the command &amp; colors system at the top of its form. Still light and easy to play, but with a couple of new elements (namely leaders, evasion maneuvers and the interesting characterization of units) that bring to the system the right amount of strategy and tactics. I need to play it more to confirm the vote, but I think it&#8217;s a really good design so far.  I like the wooden blocks. Illustrations are not exactly stunning, the board and the cards are of... well... GMT quality, but there&#8217;s nothing to really complain about: everything works just fine. </comment>

However, the looks aren't that good. I'm also afraid, that because it his hard to tell one unit type from another, C&amp;C Ancients is much harder to grasp.  This is a good game though and I'd be happy to play it anytime. But at least for now, I'll stay true to Memoir.   2013-01 The fact that it's too easy to mix up the units with each other puts me off a little. Hence, I do not always want to play C&amp;C Ancients but will never turn down a game. 9-&gt;8</comment>

    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United Kingdom">spanning from Rome Vs. Carthage and Alexander the Greats campaigns. This one is more absract looking than the others using the same system (Memoir 44 and Battlelore) and has a different publisher, meaning that the plastic models are replaced by wooden blocks which look lovely, but the board is thin and nasty.   It is still a wonderful game and for me personally I have found the battles more tense and exciting than those in the other games.  </comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">The 3rd game in the Command &amp; Colors series behind Battle Cry and Memoir '44. Probably a better game than either of these two. Better than Battlelore also. It still has dice and cards so the luck is a bit on the heavy side but the cards are more diverse in this game and the rules give the players more meaningful choices. You also get more different types of units.  For those thinking that plastic minis would be better for a game like this I think I've come to actually prefer the blocks. The blocks are easier to handle and easier to tell apart in my opinion. Imagine 13 different types of units including 5 different infantry units and 3 different calvalry units each of which look similar. The blocks are also easier to store.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Greece">Second only to CC: Napoleonics for me! If you have the space and money both are worth having. If I had to choose I would say go for CC: Napoleonics because of the number of dice changing according to unit strength, all the different terrain effects and the more efficient artillery. If you love the ancient period wars though it's a must buy!</comment>

    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">A refined, and slightly more complex, version of Memoir '44 and Battle Cry. The blocks look very good when set up, the gameplay is very, very good and the scenarios are just plain fun. A couple of cons: the included dice are pitiful and the logo on the map looks cheesy. But the box will survive WWIII. Highly recommended!</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">C&amp;C:A is my 1st foray into war games. I researched and selected it very carefully, so it's not surprising that I quite like the game. Overall it is much easier to learn to play then I expected. Though beware of the first play when all the stickers need to be applied (seriously an hour+) during initial setup. Once the rules/system are understood the game is fast and tense.     It is worth noting that most of the scenarios are NOT balanced, so any competition should be based on playing the scenario twice (switching sides) and summing the margins of victory/defeat.  Overall a fantastic medium-light wargame that should be easy to enjoy for the majority of strategy gamers.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Scotland">In the same vein as Battle Cry &amp; Memoir '44, which I both enjoy. More variety in the unit types here which adds something new, but makes it a bit more complicated as a result. Enjoyable.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Greece">Great gateway wargame. It uses the famous game system with the cards and the board divided in sections found in many games like Memoir 44, BattleCry BattleLore... In Ancients the addition of leaders take the gameplay to a higher level. The game mechanics remain simple but they provide a lot of interesting choices. Each battle takes about an hour. It is truly an enjoyable game. </comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">After four plays, Suburbia debuted at #5 on my [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/143773/admiralacfs-game-rankings]list of favorite games of all time[/url], but I've since dropped it a few spots.  I still really enjoy it and love the Sim City-like feel of it, but I'm a bit concerned about the balance.  The PR Firm is very strong, and the basic Park tiles seem like they're very powerful compared to the tiles available in the market.  The end-game bonuses also seem rather swingy.  That said, I still really like the game, but it has its flaws.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United Kingdom">Still feel there's so much more to learn with this game. Feels so light yet I think it's deceptively good and heavy thinking. Great need to track what other players have with the "every" tiles.</comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="Canada">Great depth for its length. Public goals keep the game changing and make it tense and along with global tile interaction it keeps the game interactive.  Only play with 3 because too many goals are tied in 4p (esp. those where you have least of whatever) and too much gets discarded from the track to plan.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Quickly ascending to become one of my favorite gateway Euros.  A nice tile-laying 'Sim City' type of game, where you build your own suburb to hopefully meet the requirements of one or more end-game goals (or you can completely ignore the end game goals and try to just get points in other ways--though I've never seen a player emerge victorious that way).    While the game looks a little dry, it actually is quite interesting how the theme has been incorporated into many of the tiles (e.g., the hotel will give you benefits based on the residential tiles your neighbors have built, while the resort will give you benefits based on all of the residential tiles in the game--after all, why would someone go to a hotel in their own neighborhood?).  There is a fair amount of interaction between tiles played in your own suburb and tiles that other players place in their suburbs, so I purchased some of those nifty metal cubes out of the Geek Store so that people can mark tiles in their suburb that are affected by non-adjacent tiles in their own suburb or tiles in other suburbs to remind them to not forget the related benefits.  It can be a bit unruly otherwise to track all of the various movements until you've played a few times.  </comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="Canada">It's a good game and I like how everything makes sense. Also, once you play a few rounds, the scoring becomes more natural. Too bad it's a bit heavy for my normal group and only plays up to 4 or I'd play it more often.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United Kingdom">I like this a  bit more every time I play it.  For a game with separate 'player boards' there is a decent amount of player interaction beyond just denying other player tiles.  It plays fairly quickly and provides a decent amount of depth, and the variety of goals and tile mix ensures each game plays differently.  Another plus in it's favour is how it smoothly copes with all the varying effects that tiles have.  </comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Very impressed by this tile laying city building game. The theme of building a suburb can hardly be less appealing to me... yet this game pulls it off. Indeed, its theme actually drives the mechanics very well in how various tiles impact your borough. There is some talk about the secret goals not being fair or thematic, but I found them tactically interesting and don't necessarily mind if they make 100% sense.</comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Great game. Plays smooth and is surprisingly engaging, despite the dry as dirt theme.   Only issue is the tracking of globally triggered events. We solved this by marking the tiles with global triggers with a red cube (from another game) so they wouldn't be overlooked. </comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Portugal">Probably after Hannibal and CombatCommander, this is the card driven wargame more often played by me. Very tense and stressful, unforgiving with the mistakes of players. Iconic in the world of wargames.  2014 - After so many years playing it I bought it myself to study more careful the variant Victory conditions and the multiple paths to the victory.  _____________ // ______________ 2015 (Edit) A solid 8 as a Game.  A CDG with lots of things around and lots of Game BUT A VERY POOR SIMULATION OF WW1. There is no sense of Fronts so characteristic in this conflict. Italy it's a shame! What's the historical reason for so many VPs in the Italian peninsula?! Experienced players never put Italy in the war and Romania rarely has any role during play. The CRT it's good representing the attrition battles of the War BUT the ability to join 6 or more Armies (XXXX) in an attack / offensive is highly unrealistic!! Another thing annoying in the game is the Offensive rolls at the beginning of the turn. So artificial! After playing "The First World War" from the same designer (Phalanx) you have a more realistic feeling of WW1 and the need to attack and made offensives! Ahh! and the mandatory offensives with a single depleted corps?! GAMEY! Anyway POG it's a breathtaking and stressful exercise that feel good to return time to time. A favorite of my two playbuddies. Lately, We only played POG with the historical setup variant. A game of POG can vary greatly in duration: 1 to 9 hours!</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">This game is tough, not rules wise, but gameplay. The more I play the more it looks to me that I'm really bad at it, which in return drives me to play it more.  As for the complaints that game is not historical, forget that. If I wanted to explore the history of WWI I would read a book about it, but in this game, each session gives a nice what if scenario.  Well deserved in its high rankings.</comment>

It also represents fairly well the War to end all wars. With some more plays (8 so far) to this and other card driven I will review my rating, probably raise it.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">Great game but there's work to do on it. Read "le banquet des g&#233;n&#233;raux" for variant rules if you want a realistic simulation, or play the original rules if you want a abstract boardgame. </comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Belgium">The granddaddy of heavier war CDGs. Although the game usually develops along very unhistorical lines, the cards help give it a lot of a flavour. Very unforgiving supply rules make for potentially unstable situations that demand plenty of attention, but generally the strategy feels right, and the progression through the war decks to limited and total war is a great idea. It also suffers less from the different front problem than its WWII counterpart, Barbarossa to Berlin, though the Mid East seems at best a side show.   I think the only major flaw is that there aren't enough mechanics in the game to reward progression along more historical lines in some rather crucial events (Italy, US, Russian revolution...) A great game, unfortunately slightly too long to play comfortably in an evening.</comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">This is an initial rating based on a couple PBEM games (neither of which were really played to their conclusion).  Still...the small taste I had of this one left me hungry for more.  Between managing your decks (trying to bring more of your cards into the game), resupplying your armies, bringing new armies into the field, and managing multiple fronts, this game has plenty of tension and tons of interesting decisions.  Can't wait to play it again.  Update:  This game RULES.  One of my favorites when I'm in the mood for a longer more in depth experience.  There's also PLENTY of info and variants that give this game even more historical authenticity.  Well worth your time.  The only reason this isnt ranked higher is play time.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">Very similar to Ascension, but the game play is much smoother.  The use of iconography instead of just text and the artwork is significantly better.  I also enjoy the fact that you always have a target for your attacks (your opponent) instead of it being a randomly drawn monster.  The attacks also have more of an impact as it directly affects your opponent.  It does play very well (read best) with two, but it also played well with four in 2 vs 2 teams.  </comment>

My initial thought is that the game would be too random, but the more I play the more I understand the strategy that goes into playing well.   I understand that it can play up to four people.

    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">The best deckbuilder in my opinion.  It elegantly sidesteps all the problems that usually bug me in the genre.  This is a game where you MUST build a deck that makes effective combos of cards to do well, but unlike other deckbuilders, a careful player can almost always do so, and none of the mechanics of the game fight against your ability to build the deck you want.  The tradeoff is that it really only works with two players (I'm not a fan of the multi-player variants, most lifted from Magic, detailed in the rules), but I usually play this type of game with two anyway.  One of very few games that I'm pretty much always up for playing.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="United States">I got the decks and then bought the app.  I have way over 1,000 plays on it and this is one fabulous game.  You can play it in about 20 minutes: 5 on a phone.  It is a challenging with a lot of strategy in a small package. Don't believe the noise about luck of the draw and obvious choices.  If you think that is true, get the phone app and play the A.I. on the difficult level.  You have to know the value of the cards beyond their cost and how they fit into your deck.  You have to develop a strategy, as chaining same-faction cards is extremely powerful and each one has its advantages.  You have to realize that sometimes you shouldn't spend "money" that you have to acquire ships, just because it is there, as deck-cloggers can kill you.  You also have to know just when to trash a card and take the chance that you can pull off the win. Greatest filler I have ever played: hands down!</comment>

It seems like there are plenty of options, and the play time is short...almost too short, though.  It seems like your engine never really gets going before the game is over, but it's still a good run.  Can't beat the box size!  NOTE: 4-player game with standard rules is NOT recommended.

Though the mechanics are similar and simple, the random confrontation battles are refreshing and quick.   Comparatively speaking, it can never be a war-ish game. The battles do not allow 'responses'. It is a matter of UGo-IGo system. So it resembles a chess game where players do their best with whatever cards they have at that time.   Good simple family game. </comment>

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="England">It's hard not to like this. Eagle have finally gotten a fully developed game to rank alongside their excellent production values. This, of course, is down to Martin Wallace and the fact that the game has in essence undergone a long development cycle right back to Lancashire Railways. I hesitate to call Railroad Tycoon 'Age of Steam' lite as some have done because it isn't really lite. It just places more emphasis of the 'fun' aspects of the game rather than Age of Steam's tendency to push the 'gamer' limits. RT certainly has more theme to it than AoS and is more forgiving to the casual gamer. AoS remains my favourite game but I'm quite happy to own both.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">I must admit I like this game more than I thought I would. The gameplay has just the right amount of depth -- enough rules and options to be interesting but not overwhelming. The game length is a workable 2 hours or so (even with 5 players). All 3 games I've played have been very different, which bodes well for replayability (and I haven't even touched Chicago yet!). Negatives: quality problems with the board and components (see sbabcock's review).</comment>

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Netherlands">This games is really excellent. it is not in the same "weight" category as Age of Steam but that means it is more accessible. It also has the feel of a family games. One caveat: remove the bonus card to upgrade to a 4-link train when playing with 2. The Geek variants where it is suggested to reduce the board size for 2 players work really nicely too. Edit: After many more plays, a couple of clumsy things still grate: the unclear rules esp. governing the bonus cards; the ability to block someone's half-finished track; and the Start card issue mentioned above. For those reasons I have downgraded my rating from 9.4 to 8.5!</comment>

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">Very good, very clean track building and resource delivering game. I do wish there was a little bit more you could do with your money or debt to make things more interesting, but the special action cards add at least a little bit extra decision content to the game state.  I like that the design is intuitive and have enjoyed every play so far. But part of that is that I've had access to a wide variety of maps to play with that change the feel of every game. The system itself can feel a bit samey a bit too quickly in my opinion without the availability of more maps.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">2-6(5)  2p Mexico map: There does seem to be a bit of a runaway leader, especially with some of the early bonus cards that can establish an early financial lead that will later turn into a point lead that can be insurmountable. Pretty tight and a solid logistical exercise.</comment>

His aproach to wargames is opening this door for a lot of people who probably never aproached them before. And that is no small feat. When you play CC, you either hate it or love it.

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">GMT games are like crack to me. I want them and I want them to make me feel good about myself, but often they put me in a daze and ruin my life. I think it has something to do with the density of the rulebooks and the sneaking suspicion that I'm playing wrong in some way. However, there is still something about them that keeps me coming back. Combat Commander is a big reason why.  At first glance the game may look stodgy or square or for old people with no taste in the razzmatazz of modern board games. It looks like it should come with a bag of Werther's Originals. However, upon playing the game and seeing the excitement of opportunity fire, random sniping, triggered events, white-knuckle rally rolls, and unexpected swings of fortune, it reveals its true form - that of an unpredictable, yet satisfyingly strategic game of tactical prowess.   It calls to me from the shelf, wanting me to match wits against a worthy opponent and see just what way the twelve scenarios (or countless generated scenarios) may go. It's just a brilliant game that is far more simple than at first glance and far more sweet for it. Just like a Werther's Original hard candy.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="New Zealand">A really exciting game, once you get started.  Can be slow at first when you've a handful of artillery/fire/advance cards and all you want to do is move forward!  Very good fun.</comment>

This time around I was able to get in to the demo at Conquest 2006.  Played against JaggedTech(Greg) in the demo scenario.  Very tight game, ended with  1 vp for the RUSSKIES.  The flow of the game works well with the card, lots of tough choices but yet played very fast.  We completed in 2 hrs.  Kind of reminder me of Up Front.  Glad I preorder on P500.

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Poland">Nice balance of luck and strategy. Can be unpredictable and uncontrollable (like real combat?). Some games may be very one-sided, but other times there can be big swings back and forth.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Pretty good.  Not a huge fan of the card-driven system here, as it makes things kind of unrealistic (inability to fire when the enemy is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU).  No tanks, which isn't necessarily bad.    Components look nice, and rules are easy to read, but sometimes it's just not enjoyable to play a game of hand management when you'd rather be playing a game about war.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Despite ostensibly well-written rules, I find them to be too terse. Perhaps I'm just too new to war gaming and jaded by excellent rules such as Conflict of Heroes. The rulebook worked very well for looking things up (though not always expediently, as you'd have to follow a chain of 8 references for an answer), but I feel like it's too concise and succinct.  Gameplay overall is interesting; the abstraction of the various mechanics into card draws is clever, if a bit frustrating, from time to time.</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United Kingdom">A clever, thematic game with fabulous production quality.  I admire the design and the way the game operates, but for me there was too much to take in, so I really didn't know what strategy I should try to follow.  For our first (4 player) game it took close on 5 hours to complete, by the time we'd waded through 90 mins of setup and rules.  The expected mid-game scoring for a ticket pile depletion didn't happen because the bag unexpectedly emptied of meeples.  For virtually every move we had to refer to a very useful member-created player aid which detailed step-by-step all the things you had to do for each worker you placed. If we skipped looking at the aid we tending to forget one of the 7 or 8 things you had to remember to do, in the right order.  Without that aid we'd have been all over the place, so a big thank you to user schnel and his aid found here: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/126498/one-page-player-aid-gallerist-version-10  Although the kicked-out worker feature seems pretty neat, it does disrupt the flow of play and can result in a fair bit of downtime before your turn comes round.  And with only four worker placement spots the kicked-out action happens quite a lot (in a 4 player game, maybe it wouldn't with fewer players).  A great game but too many fiddly rules with a plethora of possible end game bonuses to try to choose from means I'm not hurrying to play it again.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Poland">After first play: the components are really great and thematic. However, it seems that in order to win the player should concentrate on visitors managements. All the main Gallery activities as discovering and developing of artists and buing and selling of work of art are less important that having the right combination of visitors on the lobby and in the Gallery for receiving lots of money and influence during the game and at the end of the game.</comment>

Adem&#225;s es muy fr&#237;o el juego, muy poca interacci&#243;n e indirecta, salvo la de mover a otros que vayan a la galer&#237;a contraria, hacia la tuya, que apenas sucede, no da tiempo. Gusta pero no apasiona, extremadamente euro seco.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Spain">Juego con bastantes minireglas complicadas de retener a pesar de estar bien vinculado con el tema. S&#243;lo una partida aun en modo solitario. Tengo que jugarlo m&#225;s pero pinta bien.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="">Very good, fairly heavy Euro. Lots of housekeeping to keep track of but the player aid makes it easy. You don't get blocked from actions or messed with by other players like you can in Kanban. "Kicked out" actions keep everyone involved. Outstanding components.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Cyprus">A very good game. The only thing i dislike is the colour pallet. Heavy but with a reasonable duration and it flows naturally even during the first plays.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="">This is a complex euro with an enjoyable theme and aesthetic.    I admire the originality of the design which provides for a worker placement which, if it displaces another player's worker, thereby gives that player a modest, out of turn order, possible action to take.  Does this result in a somewhat peculiar rhythm for the game?  Yes, somewhat.  The end game goal in the game is to finish with the most money (not my favorite end game goal), and as such, worker placements which provide you with money, now, and in the future, are always on your mind. An alternative thing to strive for in the game is influence, which is tallied on an influence track, and spent during the game to get actions, or boost artist reputations, etc. I liked that aspect of the game.  The movement of people (meeples) into and out of lobbies and galleries is clever though perhaps a little less interesting than it seems it should feel.  This IS a spatial challenge, or is it?  Are we competing here spatially?  Perhaps.  Maybe not.  All in all, I really want to give Gallerist an 8, as I have for Kanban, a game I do love, but after one play, Gallerist just didn't quite grab me, or make me smile as much as Kanban did.    As such, my enthusiasm for playing a second game of Gallerist is about a 7, not an 8.  Nevertheless, I am hoping that on second play, the gaming experience will improve to an 8.  November 2015.  Second play was an improvement, and in consideration of the clever design, particularly the influence track, and the amusing paths to gaining money and influence in various places on the board, going to raise it to an 8.  December 2015.</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Denmark">Well, I had been looking forward to playing this. Was even more excited after getting the game in the mail. The box is gargantuan and the component quality is off the charts. Sat down to learn the game. The thing is, for all the hype, there has always been something that seemed a little off for me about the game. I couldn't figure it out. After reading the rules and watching a few videos it still seemed very unclear to me how one should go about playing this game. I still had that feeling while playing it. On one hand it was quite fascinating. The influence track and the kickout actions are quite innovative. On the other hand, your success seem quite dependent on how others play the game. This is of course the case in all worker placement style games, but whereas in most worker placement games, the actions of the other players either hurts you (by blocking your spot) or does nothing (takes a spot you wouldn't have taken), in this game it is the other way around. Nobody can take a spot from you, other players either do nothing for you or they actively help you, by bumping you from a spot giving you a kickout action or by buying pieces of art from an artist that you also have art from, boosting the value of your own piece of art. It's defintely interesting and different from what I'm used to, but while I was hoping to love it, it was more a case of finding it interesting. I most definitely want to play it again, but the rating of this is up in the air. Maybe I'll see the light and it'll become a favourite or it could be a complete flop. Time will tell. I will say this in its favour: it is definitely not just another euro and that is a good thing!  Prelimenary rating: 7.5</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">This one got better the more I played it finally played it at 4 players and still was a great time. It can get very chaotic at 4 the the kicked out actions but as long as you are mindful and keep track that's not so bad. It can be a points salad but I say grab a fork and pass the croutons. </comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Canada">Very deep game. Needs many more plays before I can say I get it. Hope it does not get swamped away soon. </comment>

Bit of a hybrid what with the dice-chucking but I'm leaning towards Euro due to the heavy resource management and area control elements. Cracking game, always a tense buildup to an exciting end.

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Fantastic game.  Each faction is unique and balanced.  And it plays rather quickly. And it's usually rather close, rarely does one player shoot ahead.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Love this game, but the hard 4-player requirement means it doesn't make it to the table very often.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Fun game and funny theme. It could be the best area control game I've played. I wish it scaled to a number of players other than 4 though.</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Canada">2010 02 19  I like the successful combination of euro and ameritrash mechanics. First impressions are good, but something keeps it from being great. I'm still quite curious to play some more, so it has good potential to go up in rating. </comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Germany">Chaos in the Old World is another hybrid game combining area control mechanics with asymmetrical race balances and dice-rolling. The game really shines in its fair amount of time, it can be played and a game mechanism which nearly guarantees tense games and photo finishes every play. The one and really con is that its pretty much restricted to 4 players, because all different gods are pretty much needed to keep the game balance and leaving one god out, will favor the one or the other remaining. The game wont get boring after a lot of plays, which is another proof for well developed games.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Love the theme and mechanics.  Really want to explore this more.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">lot of fun  and very thematic. relatively simple mechanics.  Just need to figure out how to keep Khorne in check.  Sometimes tough getting 4 to the table.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Canada">Rated 8 based on first play. My initial thoughts: this is great and will probably upgrade rating in future. I see a lot of potential here... Plus we played with 2 players only (each controlled two gods) and I imagine it will be way more awesome with 4 (will see abt that this weekend)!  Upgraded to 9. Really like this one. Great theme. Lots of intricacies to keep track of. While some people find the theme too dark - playing on a map of human skin, corrupting the world, etc - I played this with my parents and they had a blast. They didn't even notice that the map was 'human skin' and thought it was a really cool game. I guess it depends on how deep you personally immerse yourself into the theme.  I really like games with asymmetrical play. This game is fairly easy to get someone new playing. Strategy and the indepth rules can be taught along the way.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">I finally got a chance to play this game, and I really liked it. I can see why you have to have 4 to play, but this game left me wanting more. I'm excited to try it again with my regular group.  What I really liked about this was that each player is seeking victory in a different way, and those different paths look to be very balanced. The game itself is an area control game mostly, with randomized setup and events throughout the game. On top of the mostly Euro underpinnings, FFG has layered a ton of theme, and some ameritrash elements.   I'd put this game into the same category as Dungeon Petz as a Euro/Ameri hybrid, with elements of both.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Australia">An asymmetric euro with a lot of charm.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">I like it, but it is really punishing on new players. If anyone misplays a single turn, they can king-make or knock themselves out without even realizing it.</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">I do not like the art of Chaos. It turned me off from the game for awhile because it's just a little bit too over the top with its dark fantasy theme. But Chaos really does have some fascinating gameplay. I like the asymmetrical factions a lot. They have such different goals and abilities to struggle for victory. I'm okay with the design philosophy of if they're all equally broken, then they're balanced.   But some races do seem strictly stronger and weaker (red faction is just annoying how much they will stomp rookie players by sheer force of exploding sixes and silliness). Chaos is a rough, darkly themed game that I can't really recommend very widely. But I still find the dynamic of the unique factions to be very neat.</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United States">This is an interesting take on the Age of Steam idea.

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United States">An incredibly tight, well designed game where every decision seems important. Very thinky and surprisingly only slightly mathy (which is a blessing for me). The strategy is deep and cut throat and there's zero luck involved. I agree with others - the basic game is wonderfully light in rules and plenty engaging even for the most experienced gamer. Another game that deserves the accolades.</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United States">Age of Steam Redux.  Not having played the original AoS yet, I can't compare the two.  What I can say is that Steam plays quickly and smoothly.  I hear it's less painful and more forgiving than AoS, not to mention faster.  I enjoyed it and would gladly play again.  An excellent train game.  By all means, give Steam a shot.</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Brazil">Great game, I think I liked it over Railways of the World, the only thing I like more in Railways of the World is the economy mechanics of getting an action ticket, but in all other aspects, Steam seems more well made.

They all have their own strengths and weaknesses, but I *think* that I've settled on Steam being my favorite...   I'm still experimenting with it and I've honestly only played expansion maps so far! So I really need to do some more exploring. Overall, I like the options Steam presents even though it lacks a little bit of variability and the income vs points track mechanic is a bit weird.  Own base game + map expansions 1 &amp; 2.</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Norway">I've tested it with two different gaming groups. One that expected it to be RRT and was disappointed before it started. And one that like Eurogames, and liked it very much.  This is far more competitive than RailRoad Tycoon, but still less "annoying" than Chicago Express. I recommend RailRoad Tycoon for more casual gaming and this one for a real game. Disclaimer: I haven't played AOS, so I can't compare to that.</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Canada">I have only player the standard game once. As one of the players said, it didn't feel as epic as Railroad Tycoon.   It certainly felt a lot drier to me.  In general I prefer tighter, more streamlined games. So I hope this improves with further playings, as I had higher hopes for it. </comment>

    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">+ Upgrading your abilities is fun and interesting and can lead itself to different strategies; The leader of the auction having such a distinct advantage is a very cool twist in this game. - Very dry theme; Getting screwed over by the "colonist flip" really stinks.</comment>

    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">2-4(4)  New version. It does feel a bit dated in the components and how spare the game mechanisms are (games seem to be gravitating toward "kitchen sink" designs). But, nevertheless, it has a solid auction system that holds up for two players and then just a lot of constraint on your choices and what you'll be able to accomplish within the game. Upgrades on the various tracks are essential, as you hate to take actions when you've not upgraded, but you need to balance that with actually doing things.  A fine Euro that holds up (better than Princes of Florence, for example).</comment>

While I love the themey self-perpetuating building mechanic, I think some of the cards could be more effective and the little skittering wine tokens are reason enough I'll probably never play it again. Played again- upgrading to 8.4 again. I love to hate this one.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United Kingdom">Gateway+ level worker placement, but compelling. Flows really nicely, theme well integrated, a few different routes to victory. Plays 1-6p without getting bogged down. Love it!</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">A very thematic, scalable, easy to learn, worker placement strategy game about developing your personal winery.  Yes yet another worker placement, and yes even another wine making game, but this game is good, very good.  The artwork is pleasing, the components are high quality and unique, the theme is strong, to play is easy to play well is challenging, it plays 2-6 players, and it has a plethora of expansions.  The goal of the game is to be the first player to 20 points (or to score even higher in the round when someone scores 20).  Each round you choose turn order, with each position being provided a benefit for the round, the better the benefit the later you go as going first is very important.  On your turn you place a worker and execute the action, with each action having more than one space but limited space and with each having a bonus for the first person to take it.  The big twist is that each game round occurs in two major seasons, summer and winter, and if you use all of your workers during summer, you will have none left during winter as you don't get workers back until the end of the year, also there are different and valuable actions in both seasons.  There is a pause in between seasons (fall) where you acquire a bonus card.  There are a couple of odd/disconcerting aspects to the game.  There are bonus cards available in both summer and winter but there are not at all balanced.  Also money is very tight during most of the game but then you are often cash flush late in the game and there is no longer any real use for it.  Going first is absolutely critical late in the game and you can get completely locked out through no fault if your own due to the rotating turn order selection.  Apparently some of the expansions and new updated rules address some of these issues and the designer seems very in-tune with the gaming community and he is always looking for feedback and making improvements.  This is an example of what all kick starters could and should be (too bad I missed the original kick starter but at least I got on board for the expansion); a top quality game with tons of extras and a designer always communicating and looking to make a better product.  Overall it's a very solid light to mid weight strongly themed euro strategy game that I would recommend by a first time designer.  Own the [boardgame=147101]Tuscany[/boardgame] expansion, which is an absolute must-have, making a very good game a great one, as well as the [boardgame=193823]Moor Expansion[/boardgame].</comment>

More so than most engine-builders, the mechanics seem very much tied to the theme. If it was re-themed as a tea plantation, I'd probably always want to be playing it!  This is the second game I've played by Messrs. Stegmaier and Stone, the first being their superior game Euphoria.

    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Greece">A very well produced and streamlined worker placement game. For me it is the preferred out of the 3 with the same theme (vinhos,grand cru).I would also like to see a non-linear wine maturity. Other than that, game is great although I would recommend it with up to 4 players unless you don't mind the duration.</comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">Initial Impression: The worker placement mechanisms in this game are supported by the muted, calming art of the board and cards. I love the glass beads and believe that more games could use them. This game is fairly easy to teach and can be used as a gateway game to the worker placement mechanism. The neutral theme aids in attracting non-gamers to the game. With multiple strategies to pursue there's enough depth for seasoned gamers as well. This is a game that I'm tempted to add to my collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">Second edition, have to play a little more before I make a final decision on the game. At this point, seems like cards can determine the winner and there's no way to catch the leader due to grande worker.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">An excellent designed worker placement with a theme that really works.  With the exception of a couple of the expanded modules everything ties in  and works well together. A lot more elegance and refinement as opposed to games like Trickerion or CoM.  I really look forward to planning my moves from season to season. The game captures my interest and keeps it; even in a game when I was losing and knew I didn't stand much chance in winning I was still looking forward to my turn. A game that is enjoyable to play win or lose!</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">It's a worker placement game that falls into a unique spot.  I think that Stone Age is a better game for 3-4, but Viticulture has the bonus of being playable to 5-6.  I think that Lords of Waterdeep is a better game, but Viticulture doesn't have the terrible downtime between turns (in my experience).  So, I'd go with Viticulure for the larger games.</comment>

    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">Gameplay wise, this is pretty fun. It's the first programming game that I think I'd enjoy replaying, and one of few games with real-time elements that I enjoy. It's also surprisingly good as a co-op - I tend to have a high bar for co-ops, and this clears that nicely. Components wise, as I'm sure, this is stellar. I'd probably say it's a 7.5 on gameplay, 10 on components, so I'm going with 8 for now.</comment>

    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">A programming game similar to Robo-Rally.  The difference is you draft the programming moves.  The cards are varied and it give the game flexibility.  I'm a fan of RR and I'm a fan of this.  The co-op part and the goal in scenario 1 was pretty cool.  It's very overproduced but that doesn't bother me.  Looking forward to playing some more.</comment>

First, it's easy to see why this is a timeless classic;  I won't say it's a great game yet, but it's definitely fun.    Second, it's claimed several of our favorite gaming moments so far.  My 5-yo got some alien power that allowed him to swap attack cards.  This became TERRIFIC fun because at first everyone realized he was always going to swap. About half-way thru the game, though, he got wise to this and stopped swapping altogether.  By the end of the game, you just couldn't tell whether he was going to swap or not, and the outcome of the game came down to me guessing whether he would.  We were all laughing hysterically.    That's what gaming is all about.</comment>

The combination of powers, and the potentially bizarre impact they can have on the game are both it's strength (variety) and weakness (rules clarifications required)</comment>

It was definitely a learning experience, but was a good first play. 2 guys decided to go together for a combined victory.

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">This game has some really interesting mechanics, particularly the order stack and deck building for combat resolution (in an area control game!). All four sets of faction cards / abilities feel very true to the 40k universe factions, and the game overall is loads of fun. I'm disappointed that this game never got an expansion before the FFG/GW split, because there's a ton of interesting design space here.  It's also very nice to have an epic, thematic conflict game where the best player count is 3 (imo). At this point I own something in that style for every common player count, so the option to play my favorite type of game is always available!  (area control; 3x)</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="">At 1 1/2 hours per player, this game is difficult to get to the table.

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Was my most anticipated game for 2015 thus far, though it might not prove the very best. That's not to put it down, because Forbidden Stars does an excellent job of capturing the conquest of the WAR40K universe with some intuitive, streamlined mechanics that make turn order and combat pretty easy to manage. Components are superb, the four races feel quite unique from one another, and it does use a lot of tried and true mechanics from other FFG games, but puts a few new spins on them to refresh them. Struggle over objectives, gather resources, build your forces. The game will really shine once they put out another 2 factions for more options.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Despite its daunting visual complexity, the game itself is streamlined for two and is probably the best (as in, only) way to play a two player space exploration game.  Knowledge of Warhammer not required, thankfully. </comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Canada">Initial Impression: This is another FFG game, so of course the artwork, cardboard components, and minis will be high quality and dripping with theme. This game centers around the mission tokens and having to give your mission tokens to your opponents ensures that every player will interact with each other. Brilliant idea. Planets and sectors have limited value other than for production so ownership will be constantly changing. The real heart of this game is in the order tokens. Which ones to place, where to place them, timing of the placement, and the order to place them. Lots of difficult decisions that make for a brain burning game. The combat system is thematic and can be simply grasped after the first few tries. Being card assisted, it also provides many decisions, while not significantly slowing the game down. I'm eager to try this game again and possibly experiment with another one of the 4 asymmetrically thematic races included in the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Come for the cool miniatures and pretty artwork; stay for the unique action selection system and solid combat system! I don't have much experience with direct conflict "Amerithrash" games but I can't find much to fault with Forbidden Stars. </comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Romania">A bit clunky. I think there are better games in the same genre than this.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Combat could have been done better maybe but its a good space conquest-lite game</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Combat is like a mini-card game within a game, which is cool. However, this prolongs the game, which makes it hard to bring out and play.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Italy">Thematic and heavy, Forbidden Stars is a good game that somehow feels like it was afraid of being even better: as a matter of fact, when playing it you can feel the rich Warhammer 40.000 theme simply drifting on the surface rather than actually dripping into every rule, action or choice as you&#8217;d expect from such a game.  For instance, accomplishing an objective is rather dry theme-wise and has no real in-game effect besides three lines of flavor text only that most players don&#8217;t even care to read (or listen to, when you try to read that piece of text aloud).  Nonetheless, I like this game although it still feels kinda rough.</comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Canada">Great 4x game. Although lots of mechanics, they integrated together smoothly and aside from some combat nuances, this seemingly very heavy game didn't take too much to learn. Satisfying sense of tech progression, nice card mechanic for building your combat deck, and entertaining combat. Our game didn't take tooo long, but the biggest knock I can see is this game has the potential to drag on well past its welcome. We played 3-player and I'm glad we didn't play 4-player, as some tables in our club were still playing this at 5 1/2 hours when our group finally packed it in (after completing this and playing a game of IKI).</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">A worthy successor to StarCraft and one of my favorite spacefight games. Really enjoy the combat system and wish they'd used it in Rebellion.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Need more plays.  Things I loved, things that caused me to say "wait a minute".  I think I will end up preferring StarCraft but this is a good, possibly great game.  Just wish it wasn't so long.  ----------  Second and third play were pretty great.  Still overly long but strategy and decisions became easier and it all came together well.

I like the addition of the card combat system giving the combat more strategy, even if it adds to the game length, and there is a ton of combat in this game. Lots of cool minis to play with and they are very detailed The overall gameplay is long so It will likely not hit the table too much, but the game is great if time is not an issue</comment>

There might well be many synergies and optimum plays but they are not apparent after one play. Played long but we all wanted to play again.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="">A fun, complex worker placement game. I'll need another few playdoughs to try different strategies.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Denmark">For me, this is the best overall game of Uwe&#8217;s recent &#8221;sandbox&#8221; style games (Caverna, Fields of Arle, Feast for Odin). The first two I ended up trading away after a few plays because they didn&#8217;t hold me interest. However, the puzzle aspect in this one and the feeling of purpose it provides seems to be keeping my interest much more. While there are tons of action spaces, I love the idea of 4 varying &#8220;powers&#8221; for each action that cost an increasing number of Vikings. This really makes you feel that you are making meaningful decisions that will affect your end game. The &#8220;luck&#8221; mechanics featuring dice are heavily mitigated and really more of a &#8220;how greedy do you want to be&#8221; mechanism than anything else. The game succeeds in its goal to feel like an epic. My only complaint (which many others have stated) is that the occupation cards feel a bit too random. It seems that there are just so many that players are more just hoping to luck into drawing one to work with their strategy. I think eventually we will use a variant so that each player drafts their own private deck of 10-15 cards that they will draw form during the game. It would add 5-10 mins to set up, but I think really pay off in terms of strategic gameplay.  Note: My copy had 4 boards misprinted. I have contacted Z-Man for replacement parts (12/14/16)</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Germany">Last played the english release Board. As 4 and 2 player game and I liked what i had played. Puzzles and cover your island with the tiles and you will receive some bonus goods, Feeding of your Clanmeeples, Hunting (D8 rolling), Ship building (three types), armed Raids (D12), Specialization of Clanmeeples, Sheeps &amp; Cattle, Forge, Luxury goods and exploring new islands to settle.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">A steep learning curve, but pretty rewarding once you internalize all of what's possible. Actually ended up being less intimidating than I thought it would be with all those action spaces, since often times,you'll know what you want to do and just have to find the action space that allows you to do that thing, which gets easier as you go.  You really get a feel of progression and accomplishment in the game, as you start off slow, and build up to really getting a lot accomplished. Similar to Agricola in that way, where it feels like you'll never get things done, and then by the end of the game you're humming along.  It's also very cool that players can take their own paths, pursuing different viable strategies.  I had kind of stopped paying attention to Uwe Rosenberg games as they all seemed to be derivative of each other in recent years, but A Feast for Odin feels much more unique, despite also having much in common with his other designs. Really fun stuff!</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">What a game!  Top of my want to play list and top 2 games of 2016 for me.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Switzerland">A Feast for Odin is a resource conversion, tile laying game that takes the model to the extreme. The centerpiece of the game is the ingenious patchwork-like spatial puzzle, that has been successfully augmented with resource collection and negative points spaces, as well as a adjacency limitations. This is a clean piece of design of the highest order. The rest of the game is a lot like previous Rosenberg games, from Agricola to Fields of Arle, so if you played any of those you know what to expect. The numerous actions are well integrated and mostly thematic, and there are side boards to expand upon, giving you many options to explore. Lastly, the occupation cards from Agricola are there, giving you a nudge in a certain direction, but for some reason they feel less interesting than in Agricola. Perhaps it is due to the large number of actions, making them feel insignificant (but they are really not). One needs to plan carefully for the most expensive actions, which bumps up a notch the game in difficulty. Overall, a great game, but from my perspective a lesser game than Agricola. Recommended.  + the patchwork mechanism is ingenious + highly thematic + lovely components, art and richness of material + works equally well at all player counts + great graphics design, helps the game learning immensely + the rulebook is exceptional, all our questions were answered clearly  = quite complex to play well = takes a very long time to explain, and at least one training throwaway game  - the setup and tear down take quite long - sometimes less is more</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Germany">Played several times. A very good and complex euro-game with a cute design and theme.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">Might give it a 9 if it weren't such a beast to setup/cleanup. Best Rosenberg since Le Havre. Not sure if the excessive Tetris-ing will do it for everyone, but it works for me. I really like this more than Caverna because the array of buildings in Caverna that were available for picking was just too much. And the array of standard spaces was too small. Here, there is a generous array of places to send your workers, and it's fixed for the whole game. Although the bazillion occupation cards do provide some augmented actions for the player who plays them. There are a couple dice elements to the game, and some Rosenberg purists may bristle at this, but it didn't bother me too much.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United Kingdom">First the good. Lot's of space to explore, levers to pull, synergy to exploit etc. For many people that's an instant win. The tradeoff between loss avoidance and just gunning for quick and easy points is genuinely interesting.  It is a solitary puzzle though, which isn't my favourite kind of game. Nevertheless, when I want to play a game like that (which is frequent as not all of my friends like conflict as much as I do), this is at the top of the list. I am slightly worried that the strategies may be baked in, but time will tell.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">Still enjoy this after my first 6 games. I am stuck in 120 point land and I am looking for ways to improve my score. Will probably not end up being in the same league as Le Havre, Ora or Agricola.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">A truly heavy strategy game both literally and figuratively. So many ways to play that the replayablity is near infinite.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">A very fun game with many different ways to progress.  The rating on this one could go up with more plays.  Very fun game!</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Germany">nice mix of typical UR mechanisms, though luck is more important than usual (lucky/unlucky card drawing and dice rolling can make quite a difference)</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Sweden">Good game but I actually think it's too friendly and not enough competing for spaces and actions. A friendlier version of Caverna/Agricola so to say. If you prefer a less cut-throat game that is good, but I think it became too much a solitaire game as you didn't really have to bother about what the other players did.  The game is very well done and everything fits nicely together. Easy to teach and easy to play (even if it's hard to play well :)). The tetris mini-theme is cool as well as you try to fill out your different boards.  Much better second time, might be an 8 after all?</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="United States">The game takes a little bit to set up, and a littler longer to tear down.  The whole presentation of 16 double sided resources and a 60-some space action board is really overwhelming.     That said, Uwe Rosenberg is a wizard.</comment>

The game comes in a big box with space for cards and future expansions. It has a huge board and 2 spellbooks to place your cards in. Rules are not very complex but each card has a lot of abilities and keywords. The tutorial game takes about an hour but the full game took us over 3 hours! You have so many options in this game so it is prone to Analysis Paralysis. Nice artwork.  I admit that the game is very thematic and with a lot of tension and fun. I like the tactical options it provides. You just need a dedicated partner to get the most out of the game. </comment>

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United Kingdom">Age of Steam is a game full of decisions on priorities, on where and how to expand, and on how much you dare spend.  Oh, and woe betide the player who does not pay close attention to what his opponents are doing. I find playing AoS an engrossing experience.  It benefits hugely from being the fourth iteration of the Early Railways system; a much longer development cycle than is usual.   Having said all that, the game is not faultless. Management of resources in the early game is absolutely critical - to the extent that there can be no way back from a poor start. The final victory point count of track segments is really fiddly. And the rules, while better than the usual Warfrog standard, could still be better organised.</comment>

    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="England">Quite strategic as 'German' games go because you need to have a plan in mind when you start the game - or at least adopt one quite quickly. The sort of game that I find very dry and a bit dull these days but still up there as one of the best eurogames</comment>

    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="United States">This one I like!  Many options for strategy.  Lots of choices.  Player interaction via auctions and limited supply.  Very interesting!  Rating may improve with additional plays.  I'm glad I bought this one.  Note:  There's a problem playing this with 5 players.  The obvious opening round move is to snag a Profession card with one of your two actions (draw 5, keep 1).  5 players means 6 of the 21 Profession cards remain.  The 5th player to get a Profession card will draw only 2, keep 1.  Very, very bad compared to 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.  Best played with 4, not 5.</comment>
    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="Brazil">Great auction game, I enjoyed every aspect of it, the positioning of buildings on the city reminds me of Antiquity (of course it was Antiquity that took this idea from Princes of Florence). Making the jobs is important but not the only way to achieve victory. It don't even manage to deliver enough points, but being without money is very dangerous, so you deliver works almost every round, the rounds you don't are the ones were you can make more points and achieve victory. Excellent game.</comment>
    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="United States">Low player interactions...but that means that other people cant really screw you over.  There is player interaction, but not much at all "people trying to screw each other" interaction...which I like about the game.  Great game with a fair amount of depth, and very little luck. A great opportunity for skilled players to be able to win without relying on luck, and without allowing people to go into 'gang up on the leader' mode.  (Of course, if those are the things you like in a game, this probably isnt for you.  I myself like to have a chance to win or lose a game based on skill, and not based on which players got screwed over by which other players actions.</comment>
    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="United Kingdom"> where you become a patron of the arts and try and oversee the creation of the greatest works by building theatres, laboratories and also lakes and parks for those silly artists to get inspired by.   The first part of each turn is an auctioning game. Thing is, while there are several of each item only one player can take each auction item every turn, so you may have to adjust your plan!  The second part of each turn you can choose two further actions - buying buildings, completing works etc.  The time constraint is brutal and forces very efficient play.  Update: Trading as never gets played. This is the Rio grande Alea big boxed sized edition.</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">I don't think it can be overstated how great this game is. It actually works! Unlike many card games that depend on luck luck luck. This one has some actual strategy and reward for shrewd thinking. And what's more, is that, as a fan of LotR and The Hobbit, you are in for a treat with some of the awesome character cards and parties you can build.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">(Solo) 4/13/13 - After 7 plays i've played the first scenario exclusively as i've tried to learn how it all works. Spirit looks to be the foundation of any successful deck at this point. It's questing and enemy nullification cards make it indispincible. Leadership pairs nicely with it, with solid resource generation and versatility. Lore is good for support with healing and card draw. I haven't had much luck with Tactics, the only sphere where i've lost a hero...both times Gimli.   As far as deck construction; it really comes down to finding what you like, or want to accomplish and then build it carefully. A big part is concentration vs. versatility. The more concentrated a deck is, the more frequent you will get the cards you need, but you wont be able to do things outside your zone. The more versatile your deck is, the better able you will be to meet various challenges, but you'll find yourself with more unneeded cards in your hand.  4/20/13 - After much himming and hawwing, I came to the realization tht i'm just not in love with this game. Not enough to countinue down the rabbit hole at this time. it's a solid, beautiful game, but it just doesn't grab me. I think it's too mechanical. When I look at Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, I don't see characters; I see stats and abilities. It's the same way throughout the game. While the mechanics are good, there are too many other games out and coming soon to pump $200 - $300 in this system, espically when so many of the expansion cards are trash. I believe I have enough to be happy for now.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United Kingdom">I always go back to this one, maybe one of the games I will never give away, its replay value is massive and it always has a different feel to it even if you use the same heroes and the same scenario.</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Canada">I've played this more than just about any other game in my collection, as it was my go-to solo game for a long time. The mission structure is great and keeps it fresh for much longer than most solo games fare. Would be higher, but docked for the sheer amount of grey areas in the rules.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">Very fun, but I think that I'm going to need to get some expansions to really get into the deckbuilding aspect of the game.   6/2015 - I have now played the passage through mirkwood expansion twice with each starter faction.  The next quest seems a bit difficult but I might give it a try.  Been meaning to get Kelly's take on this, but I'm probably going to be getting some saga expasions either way.   8/2015 - Wow has this game been a hit for me the last couple of months!  I worked though the entirety of the Black Riders expansion with a self-built hobbit deck.  I need to tackle some more expansion content and look forward to continue improving my deck. </comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">There's a lot to like in this game. I enjoy the theme so maybe I'm a bit biased. It's certainly a big plus for many people. I especially like that they are not following the books. So all of the characters that you would expect are in the game or will be but the game doesn't feel scripted. But there still has to be a good game there somewhere and I think there is. I like that the game is cooperative. That aspect really seems to fit the theme very well. I like that there is a solo element to the game. That allows you to test decks easily and try new ideas. The gameplay itself is pretty intuitive and the games don't take long to play. The adventures are a nice idea and I like that each has it's own set of encounter cards. That gives each one it's own unique feel. It would be nice if there were more of them but that's what the adventure packs are for.   Many have said that the game doesn't "feel" like LotR. I understand the criticism but it really doesn't bother me at all. There are so many new elements in the game and so far the story lines are not coming from the book but are derived from them tangentially. I can understand where a lot of the cards originate but most are not mentioned in the books. So yeah, it's hard to "feel" like LotR without a lot of very specific cards that currently don't exist. I think that this will improve a lot as more cards become available. I know that the tactics deck got a big boost and certainly became more tied to the books with the introduction of the eagles in the 1st adventure pack. Also, I really don't 'feel' like a farmer when I play Agricola either but I still enjoy that game.  [8/22/11] After more plays and a couple of iterations of the FAQ things have cleared up quite a bit. Some of the wording and definitions are a bit unclear but the FAQ does a good job of clearing things up. It would be nice if they were a bit more intuitive. Still it's a pretty solid game. I've played with the 1st and 2nd adventure packs and base game adventures so far but I like what I saw. It looks like each adventure pack will have a different feel. I've also acquired a 2nd copy of the game through a trade and that has made a big difference. Playing 50 card decks is the way to play this game. Of course that now makes one of the three adventures in the starter set completely obsolete and another substantially easier. The most difficult scenario in the starter pretty much requires 50 card decks and two copies of the game anyway so at least that one is still worth playing. So at the moment it kind of sucks having only 3 adventures that will challenge you most games.   For those of you that aren't interested in building decks you can check out this list of decks for use in the game:  http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-decks/_/lord-of-the-rings-decks/  There are also several useful FFG guides to solo deck construction on FFGs website:  Part 1 http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2968  Part 2 http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2988  Part 3 http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3008</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Canada">It's growing on me.  It's taken some time to get the rules down.  It will take even longer to understand the effects of the cards, and the best way to build a deck.  I am not much of deck building gamer (up to this point), so I'm not sure how to go about it.  (At least I'm not competing against others with this game.)</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United Kingdom">Fun pick up and drop off race for gems with the only variety coming from a random layout (although that's probably sufficient). Not sure if it has enough legs for many plays though, and the rules explanation feels a bit cumbersome for the game's weight.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Canada">Fun game, players are merchants running around Istanbul trying to collect gems.  It's an interesting game that requires management of your assistants, while trying to avoid the other merchants.  Very enjoyable to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">This one is well known perhaps (certainly is around BGG) and I had high expectations. It certainly did not disappoint! The mechanics are very smart - move your stack, drop/pick up a disk to take the target action. Pay other players if they are already there. And to spice it up a bit, have special pieces to move around (and capture). There are 16 location boards that can be arrange in countless ways - so a level of replay-ability for sure. After that, alot of standard Euro goodness: 5 different resources, convert to money and then to rubies (the objective of the game is to get 5 rubies). It allows for a variety of plans to be made, paths to be taken - and just a touch of random luck (a few locations use dice) and a dash of confrontation (you can get in other's ways).  Anyhow, very deserving I think of the Spiel gamer's award. Very happy to have this one and will be anxious to play.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Canada">The game is relatively simple but with an engine-building type of strategy. I like that type of game, but it can be a bit complex for casual players. Explaining the rules takes several minutes too because you need to explain all 16 tiles plus the other rules involved. Still, I'd play this as a light-medium weight game.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Poland">I was skeptical about this one seeing how SdJ went lately, but the game is impressive. It has new or smartly re-implemented mechanics, it's quite fast, deep and not easy to decipher (in terms of strategy) despite the simple rule. One game I intend to buy and play again.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Finland">The action selection mechanism is great and the game plays smoothly. The game end and victory condition is refreshingly different than what&#8217;s usually expected in these kinds of games. The game end can be AP prone since everyone is trying to find a way to finish the game. The game works better with 4 than 5 players, especially if the starting place is in the corner. In a 5-player game it can be that the last player has to follow a path someone else is already choosing and he has to donate his starting money to the other player. This problem could have been nicely solved by giving one more coin for each player in the beginning. This way the fifth player would have 7 coins and he could pursuit for the extra storage right in the beginning.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="Belgium">Istanbul is a fairly easy grid moving game with a modular board. The task is simple: get to 5 (or 6) gems as fast as possible. The challeging part is that you have to leave one of your discs behind each time you move, and you need a disc to perform actions. You therefore have to carrefully plan every move, in order to get your discs back. Not the best game ever, but certainly very enjoyable to play, especially with newcomers since it is easy to understand and play</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">1st play: great mix of 3 of the best designers in board gaming. The art isn't quite as great as it could be but its not bad. Very interesting mechanically and solid engine building potential with lots of opportunity for tactical play. My only gripe is that the game feels like it might end before my engine is built, and there isn't a lot to distinguish the first round from the last. Not sure if that's the game's fault or mine.   2nd play: Played with 3, and the game is great. Tons of combo-ability, engine building is souped up with the second play and more experience about how to proceed. Lots of opportunities to choose a path and the multiple card powers ensure that each game and each tableau feels different.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">Lovely theme, beautiful game board and player boards, and a farming/economic game worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with greats like Agricola. The player boards are so neat, how you play farming cards to different positions for different resources and effects, and I like how the dice are used for revenue, as well as how player markers become different goods dependent on what space they are placed on. I'd say this one is a medium weight Euro that leans right just a little bit, but fairly intuitive once you've played a couple rounds.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="England">Played with three which I suspect is the sweet spot.  The game is the type I enjoy most.  Lots of possibilities and  choices which the game system allows you to do, rather than stops you doing.  The multi-use cards and the player board layouts and card lay outs were inspired, new to me and very clever.  There is limited player interaction and what there is this is largely through the game system, rather than direct, which I prefer.  The presentation has a slight &#8216;home-made&#8217; feel, which is engaging and attractive.  My first game finished 57-57-56. You don&#8217;t get much closer than that.  Getting good card combinations is clearly a key to winning and likely to mean the experienced players will do better. Maybe a minor concern that some could be a tad too strong in certain circumstances.  But maybe not in such an over powering was as in Agricola.  The delayed availability of parts of the board will also mean each game has a different feel.  Enjoyable and absorbing.  </comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="England">First Play: 4 players all first timers. The rule book is much clearer than Ruhrschiffahrt and K&amp;K but is still a little fiddly in places. Some of the helper actions need further clarification.   Multiple paths to victory but with a first play none of us really knew what the best actions should be but all acknowledged that you cant do everything. Final scores were all very close. All agreed we need to play again.</comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">Very fun game. I like the way the cards are used for several different things. I especially liked the way the dice are used for the worker placement mechanic.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United States">The first euro game I ever played and one of the first I played again upon my recent reintroduction to board gaming. Unlike most euros, planning won't win the game. Reprioritizing on the fly and knowing when to put all emphasis on a single element are skills more valuable than formulaic anticipation. It truly is the stock market- Texas Hold 'Em style. A beloved game that I rated low for reasons I don't understand. Upgraded from 7.1 to 8.5.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="England">If you read some of my other comments, you'll realise that I like games that have mutiple paths to victory and this scores as high as any other game in that respect. I'm a bit down on pure eurogames - like this one - at the moment but this is an exception beccuase it has lots of options, very good player interaction and plays really quickly for a game with so many decision points. Highly recommended and the best eurogame for several years at the time it was published</comment>

    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Australia">One of my favorite euros, there is a lot of conflict - without severe repercussions. Cool 'tech-tree' mechanic also adds to the flavor and to the range of choices. </comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United States">A pleasure and struggle for me to learn to play effectively. A beautifully themed game and wonderful balance of specialized paths to victory. Chanceless except for randomization of action discs.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United States">Choices, choices, and more choices!  So many ways to play.  After every game, I find myself thinking about how I played and what I would like to do differently.  Everyone that I've introduced this game to seems to enjoy it. --- One year later and this remains one of my favorite games.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Canada">fun, kind of like worker placement chess</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United States">Solid game. It is comparable to Endeavor - and it probably is better for all that. Certainly the strategy is more convoluted and much more confrontational. Lots of take-that in this one. My only take away is there is seemingly a very important early game in the extra action section - and if one also controls the neighboring cities, that player is in for a leading scoring position. Makes the early game a bit too obvious and requires opponents to play against them. In any event, I really like this one. Subsequent games are making me like it even more. When you get a table of nearly equal experience, this game is very, very good indeed.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Finland">2010/06 An euro that is exceptionally heavy in interaction. Nice. A potential 9er.   2013/01 Didn't have what it takes to be a 9er. Hence, an 8 feels just the right rating.</comment>

Play time can vary *greatly*.  I've had 5 player games take from 1-2.5 hours.  Do not play with the AP prone.  I like it.  There are a few different strategies to try and the player interaction usually isn't very punishing.  Can play quick and it's fun.  Give it a shot.</comment>

    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United States">2-5(5)  Preliminary rating:  This seems like the real deal.  I'm a mechanics geek and so I love the technology tracks and how they tangibly advance what you can do in the game (as opposed to just boosting you on some VP scale, or open up abilities that are, functionally, not going to affect the game dramatically).  The fact that so many points are scored at the end adds a good amount of mystery and tension to the game, and makes the initial 20 point VP track more a race than the game itself.  The way traders and merchants keep going to "stock" (the unusable pile) is a good dynamic.  The blocking is handled well, the tracks seem well balanced, the decisions about how to use merchants interesting.  And etc.  It played fast, and was short (unlike Loyang, good God), and was fun.  Obviously, the box, theme, and artwork are a bit bland (I think the board looks nice, but route-building in Old Germany???), and the play is still so far abstracted from the theme (could be a problem with the girlfriend), but when I enjoyed it this much, I don't mind.  Need to play with more because the interactions would just be that much greater.  Also, need to play with the 2p "pawn"; we've played without, as the province thing seemed to complicate things, though I can now understand why it's in the rules: to encourage blocking and the like.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Greece">Excellent light-medium euro game. Lots of interaction and tension. If you are looking for another solitaire euro game stay away from this. Very competitive game, A variety of strategies to explore. Love it! Reminds me of Endeavor but Hansa has more interaction and tougher decisions while Endeavor has better components and theme.</comment>

    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Finland">Interesting game but it someway it feels that the game ends too quickly. I want to try more. EDIT: After 2nd play the game feels even more interesting. Rating 7 -&gt; 8.  EDIT: After a few games in yucata, this doesn't feel anything special anymore. Good game still, but I have to drop the rating to 7.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Canada">Played Hansa Teutonica a few times and everybody thought there was a lot to it, enjoying the game.  My only real observation so far is that one player playing sub-par can really improve the position of another, creating an unfortunate power imbalance.  But such is the way these things go.  I quite like that I haven't figured this one out yet.  === Traded for Dixit via math trade - October 2012.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">I love this game.  To date it's my favorite Euro.  I enjoy the theme and the way it feels like you're building a dynasty.  I love the use of time as a resource, and the flexibility you have in either taking it slow or moving real fast to fill up the chronicle.  The various strategies seem well balanced.  I've seen every strategy used successfully.  And the game plays great with any number of players.  It's just as tight and tense with 2 as it is with 4.  I'm looking forward to the expansion, but the game certainly doesn't need it.  I just hope it doesn't detract from what's already an outstanding game.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">A well done action drafting game with a built in "mortality mechanic". In Village you try to ensure your family members die famous for the right things at the right time so that they are remembered in the village chronical and earn you points or that they end up in the right careers at the right time and love until the end of the game to also earn you points. The game is essentially about promoting your family in a village through different means and exploitation of resources and or time (time is a form of currency in the game and dries the mortality of your meeples). The more successful your family members are in certain careers while living, or remembered in death for what they contributed to the village, the better your score will be at the end of the game. Always worth a play in my mind.</comment>

Edit: With a second play I enjoyed the game even more and I enjoyed the expansions this time, I had a little more focus on what I wanted to do, so I can say that this is one of the most thematic euros I've known and this is a great thing for an euro.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="Canada">Rules-wise, it's not exactly complicated; but boy, it can be fiddly! There is never a &#8220;This is the best action for me right now&#8221; moment: each action is but a step in a process, and each action will, in the short term, limit subsequent actions for both you and your opponents. And your choices may end up leading you in directions that you had not foreseen!  This is due to the randomness of the cube selection each round. No, Village is not a heavily random game; but what randomness it has results in excruciating decisions. It is a wonderful balance of strategy and tactics. You need a strategy, definitely; but you need to strategize keeping in mind the rapidly changing conditions created by you and your opponents. At least once a round (whether you end up winning or losing), you will be convinced that you&#8217;ve been doing the wrong thing! In spite of all that I&#8217;ve just said, though, the game is surprisingly lacking in analysis paralysis. Negatives? Well, the colour selection of the cubes is appalling, and makes the game nigh near impossible for the colour blind, and is even a bit of a challenge at times for the rest of us! Also, the game end phase can be a long drawn-out affair, since someone has to trigger it, and it&#8217;s pretty easy avoiding triggering if you suspect that you still need to earn more VP&#8217;s. Not heavily themed, except for the aging-of-the-meeple mechanic. If you find it too dry, play it with the &#8220;give-the-deceased-meeple-a-eulogy&#8221; variant. </comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">A real gem here.  There are a lot of underlying systems at work, but they come together in a surprisingly wonderful way.  I am impressed at how smooth game play is given the variety of things going on.  This is a true strategy game--you will have to pick a path or two and really invest in it/them to do well.  The game seems well-balanced, too.  Everything just comes together so nicely.  The death mechanic, which likely draws most people to the game in the first place (it did me), is unique and compelling.  The game is a bit daunting at first, given everything that's going on, but you'll figure it out a lot sooner than you might initially think.  The farmyard "profession", and how harvesting worked with respect to meeple placement on specific areas of the farmyard (or lackthereof, as it turns out), was a bit confusing for us at first, but other than that there were no real confusing aspects in the learning process.</comment>

Involves a fair amount of luck, but skill is also important to increase win rates, up to a point of 65%-70%, if playing with average players. There is great amount of strategy involved to increase your chance to win. It is extremely addictive and can cause great havoc among teammates, when someone does something not so bright, or gets very unlucky! A set up to 1000 points, can take from 1 hour up to 4 hours since there are also negative points so be wary!</comment>

    <comment game="Jaipur" game_id="54043" location="United States">A fun game. It's always fun when you force your opponent to collect the camels!</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">After a couple of plays, I think I like it even a bit more than the Swiss expansion. There's no unbalanced country-to-country ticket situation to encounter. Having ferries and tunnels adds some interesting play tactics. Dangling that massive 9 space route out there as a prize can alter people's strategy (though I completed it in my first game AND lost). The game art is very cute with the winter theme. Overall, a real winner for the 2-3 player crowd.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Australia">A good alternative for 2-3 players. Tighter and therefore nastier than the original at these player counts.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Canada">Quite a fun map for 2 or 3 players, have always enjoyed playing this one.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">Christmas present from wife and daughter. Great 2 player version of TTR. Tighter and more complex, but we have enjoyed playing this version a lot. Haven't yet tried with 3.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Denmark">Great family game and easy to learn</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">Ticket to Ride optimized for 2-3 players.   Recommended with 2-3 players. 45 mins.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United Kingdom">My favourite TTR, although it does have a few too many special cases in the rules. Far superior to Switzerland for non-cutthroat 2P play, and a genuinely gorgeous thing to have out on the table.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Germany">What can I say, I love trains.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">Beautiful.  I'm a sucker for winter/snow-themed anything, so this has potential to be my favorite TtR game based on art alone....</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">My favorite of the TTR series. The map and components are utterly brillant. Doesn't get as much play because of the 3-player limit, but if we only have 3, this is my preferred map.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">The original can be a little loose at the lower player counts, while this one is perfectly tuned at those player counts. Just being a dumb american however the city names can be hard to talk about.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Norway">This version has a higher skill factor than the other Ticket to ride versions I have played and therefore it's really fun and cut-throat. Extra fun for a person that actually live in Scandinavia. :-)</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">2-3(3)  I love me some TtR and Nordic Countries is great for those smaller player counts. Even with two there's not always all that much blocking, but it's better than any US variant I've encountered. The small, easily gotten choke points add nice tension and it cleanly introduces the more gamey elements of Europe. Plus, it's gorgeous.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United Kingdom">Tight board good for 2-3 players with lots of ferries and tunnels</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">Ho ho ho!  I'm a Christmas elf.  I'm a sucker for Christmas.  I'm like Scrooge after he wakes up.  Snow-capped locomotives, are you kidding me?  </comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Poland">My favourite TTR to play with two players - it's tight and very interactive. Other bonuses for me include Scandinavia map (I love Nordic countries!) and snow-covered train cars which make this game great thematically for Christmas and winter time.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="">A very good two player game</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">I really like this version of Ticket to Ride. I'll need to play a few more games though before I can decide on my rating. I think it could go up from 9.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Australia">There's a few extra special rules, but the map is good and it plays well. [3]2-3</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Canada">Well the girlfriend sure enjoyed this one! She soundly trounced me. Lots of fun though. Quite a bit more depth than I would have thought as well. Still needs more plays to get a rating though.</comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">When it all comes down to it, this is probably my favorite version of Ticket to Ride, because I appreciate the snowy Winter/Christmas theme and the tighter gameplay the map brings for 2-3 players. I also find the countries fascinating but that doesn't really play much into the game itself. Most of the rules carry over from Europe, with a few small exceptions.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">Good, but I need to learn to play more aggressively as the routes lock up fast.  Whomever gets that northern route is at a strong advantage.</comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="England">The significant difference between the various factions make this game right up my street and the game play doesn't dissapoint. Best as 2 player</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Germany">Nothing really new here, but the gameplay is tried and tested and interesting. Becomes quite fiddly after a while though, AP prone, no wonder you stop after five rounds. It really makes sense to employ a time-keeping device so the players don't take too long for their turns. Lots of fun!  Very interesting is that there are multiple races that play differently. This gives substance to subsequent plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">Another great game by Ignacy!</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Luxembourg">I have played this game mostly solitaire and I really enjoy it. The solo game is not really challenging as you just have to keep small attention on the AI, but it is satisfactory to see your engine working.  With other players I now have a problem as the first game I play with them I absolutely destroy them. It is hard not to play efficiently and in this game having some knowledge of what is coming is vital.  Excellent components and enjoyable art make this a very round game.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Poland">2016-06-23 (rating 8):  I love the game. It is simple yet deep enough. Graphics are sweet.  Which is strange as I didn't like [gameid=73369] much. I wonder how would I rate it today.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Spain">Cuatro partidas a 2 probando todas las razas, el juego no ser&#225; la bomba pero nos ha gustado mucho y est&#225; muy bien balanceado. Un juego medio de gesti&#243;n de recursos, cartas, y ciertos combos, entretenido, con posibilidades varias de estrategias y decisiones a tomar. Por ahora mi r&#233;cord son 85 puntos :D jugando con los egipcios.  La expansi&#243;n a&#241;ade m&#225;s variedad de cartas con nuevas opciones para combos, y la opci&#243;n de producci&#243;n abierta. (La carta del volc&#225;n, sobra xD. O podr&#237;a jugarse de otra forma, porque a quien le salga por azar destroza demasiado al otro. O por ejemplo que obligara a destruirse un asentamiento a cada uno cuando saliera.) Por el precio que tiene vale la pena.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Ireland">Interesting card game. Finding ways to chain cool combos is fun, the civilisations feel very different, which is nice. Can be luck of the draw-ish but it *is* a card game, and it can very much be mitigated by drawing more cards. Takes a bit long with more than two people for my liking, but still enjoy it.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="">Really enjoy this game, including the one-player variant (excited to try the campaign rules). I also really enjoy the sense of escalation once you get your little engine going. My only knock against it is that the fifth and final round can go on for too long; I always end up feeling just a bit antsy during the fifth round (even in the single-player variant).  </comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Canada">A surprisingly fun medium-weight game, in spite of the non-existent theme! I like it a lot more than Race for the Galaxy, with which it's often compared. Card-game fans may be disappointed if they play with a strategy of, "I'll do this once such-and-such a card comes up," because there's no guarantee that the card you want will show up! One's strategy must be balanced with a strong sense of the tactical.  The art is OK...if you can actually see it! My goodness, the art, icons and text are awfully small on the cards. Imperial Settlers would also benefit from player aids. The only other complaint I have is the game length of five rounds: seven would have been a lot better. At the end of Round Five, you're thinking, "Hey! I was just getting started!"</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Poland">Great card game! Best with 2 players,also I like play solo.   My review: http://grambezpradu.blogspot.com/2015/12/zaawansowana-gra-roku-2015-czyli.html</comment>

I am hoping that the game is continuously expanded with more complicated cards and factions so it can retain my interest.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Australia">Really falling in love with this game. It is as light and fun or heavy and mean as you want to make it, but it is a great little ride for the reasonably short play time.</comment>

A tres tambi&#233;n va bien. Tiene modo solitario.  - El arte gr&#225;fico es muy divertido.  En contra.  - Pienso que con muchas partidas puede llegar a ser algo repetitivo, pero a&#250;n no he llegado a ese punto.  - Las expansiones que estoy viendo anunciadas no me acaban de convencer. Ser&#237;an de agradecer nuevas civilizaciones reales (griegos, aztecas,...).  </comment>

The moans about lack of conflict 2 player are nonsense - you're playing it wrong if you think this (i.e. way too weakly) - it's an incredibly aggressive game which can turn back and forth because you've so many tactical and strategic options.

Still in my minds eye a brilliant game with emergence.  Beautiful.  130700 I like playing this online, but I imagine its just that much more fun playing it in person.  But I doubt my g/f would put up with it...</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United States">{ONE&amp;}  Not to rip on Carcassonne, but I prefer this MUCH MORE over that.  With Carcassonne, the feeling is you have limited options most of the time.  T&amp;E has a refreshing area control mechanism with a rather simple and elagant system of resolving conflicts</comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United States">The first game I purchased when I refound board games (over computer games) in 2005.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United States">Deep and beautiful game. After several plays I have to downgrade it to a 9 though. The tile draw does add a little bit too much luck for my taste, on occasion. Not every game, but I have seen games that have been decided on a single lucky conflict and tile draw.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United Kingdom">This is clearly a game of great depth and is chock full of tactical play.  I'm not so sure about Strategy - sure there is some, but the game can be so fluid that in any one or two rounds tactics seem more prevalent. I was expecting the game to be 100% non-linear, but actually this is not quite the case.  Players can become entrenched within match-winning Kingdoms.  Ok, so this can be nulified, but there was more of that type of play than I'd been led to expect.  It is clear that monuments are incredibly powerful and that late eternal conflicts launched from a powerful base can swing games that are quite even up to that point. A lucky draw of tiles at exactly the right time can be a big blow to your opponent.   It's certainly heavyish and not the first game I'd pull out for two hours of fun and social-interplay, but it's a good brain-burner and I can see it will take some time to become competent at.  </comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Denmark">A beautiful game, in both design and gameplay. Lots of mind-boggling strategy. Its one of my favorites.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Canada">This game is a LOT of fun and it takes place right in the area of history I am infatuated with.  I wonder how much that plays into the overall ranking of fun, being interested in the theme?  Good game with fast, easy gameplay!</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Canada">The game "feels" like a classic boardgame, such as chess or backgammon, in terms of abstract strategy. On the plus side, it means that the fun is not based on novelty, and should therefore have nearly infinite replayability. The downside is that it can be a little dry and intimidating for some. However, definitely appeals to me, it successfully scales from 2-4 players and I have a challenging, tense game every time! The relative importance of red tiles, and the terrible effect of not having any in hand, can be perceived as a game balance flaw... but not eough to keep me from giving this one a very high rating</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Canada">I love ancient Rome, and yes this game doesn't really have anything to do with ancient Rome thematically, but it's still amazing. The mancala mechanism is brilliant and really makes me think long and hard about every decision. It really forces you to think multiple turns ahead so you don't screw yourself. Every round and every game of this will have you deciding which part of the board you should focus on. They all generate points, but to find which combination at what time is the crux of the game.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Malaysia">In term of excitedness level between the 3 Felds, I would be more excited to play Trajan because during the endgame, you feel like you've achieved something, seeing your meeples on the mainboard &amp; planning for the next game, maybe expanding military territory, or building more civil structures, or shipping more goods besides getting favors from the citizens and collecting Trajan or forum tiles. Second would be Bora Bora because lots of stuff to do and the visual is amazing including the player reference. And third is Burgundy with its simple gameplay and enough decision making to do.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Spain">Que grande Feld! Obras maestras hace este hombre (Die Burguen von Burgund, Luna, A&#241;o del drag&#243;n...) Este es otro muy buen euro, la mec&#225;nica tipo mancala del circulo de bandejas es una pasada, muy original! Muchas formas de puntuar y adaptado al numero de jugadores (otra cosa es que guste m&#225;s o menos). Crea una curva de aprendizaje de forma que cada vez que juegas ves opciones nuevas! 60 cartas mini euro azul</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">A really good Stefan Feld my wife will play. It is a solid euro and true to many of Feld's games it is a points salad with a collection of many complimentary and interesting mechanisms some of which stand out as unique or at least uncommon with a novel twist. The strength of the play experience outweighs artistic and thematic deficiencies. Definitely worth owning and always worth a play.  </comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Spain">In my opinion, Feld&#180;s best game.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Looks complicated at first but once you start playing, the game flows so well.  Actually not that hard to understand or play once you get your first game going.  Love it.  Good euro game. </comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Netherlands">Play online. Fun managing the mancala and all the mini-games within the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Greece">One of the best Feld game I've played and certainly one of my favourites! I love the mancala mechanism that you must plan ahead in order to choose your actions. The scaling of the game is excellent and it's exactly a 2 to 4 player game! I can't recommend it enough. If you're a euro fan and you like Feld's games buy it with your eyes closed!</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Very mature title, perhaps the most mature (i.e. robust, meaty) I've played from Feld.   Ironically, most of the game is relatively simplistic to unremarkable, but the mancala helps elevate Trajan beyond merely being the sum of its parts. No, there is a special kind of magic as you navigate the wealth of options available to you every round.   Update (11/21/14): Raised this to a 9 after several more plays. This game is soooo damn good; the balance between short and long term achievements is fairly remarkable. Wheels within wheels -- this game is a strategically fractal. :)</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">This is the most glorious and well-designed point salad I've ever played. Some Feld games have been "meh" for me, but Trajan is stupendous! Negative points come from your failure as a Roman aristocrat and governor to meet the demands of the populace. The mancala wheel already demonstrates the difficulty of any leader to keep a handle on bureaucracy, and the fact that your personal goals and ambitions may clash with or ignore the very people for whom your democratic republic is founded is quite interesting.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">Mancala on steroids.  Great game and I love the integration of getting "trajans" with tactical use of "mancala" tokens.  The mechanism to control the pace of the game via the mancala tokens used is pure genius.  Although the game seems to flow nicely together, some of the thematic element seem tacked on such as the forum and military conquering.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">Player interaction on this one makes things quite interesting as there are enough workers to place that competing for similar paths to victory points is a legitimate strategy. Iconography is good. More variability in player conditions would be an improvement. Awesome go-to euro.</comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Poland">great worker placement. not as heavy as Caylus or Troyes, with great feeling. quite easy to explain. </comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">This is a very fun and challenging worker placement game. In my collection thus is my favorite game of my mid-level difficulty games and top 5 in my games overall that I've played. It is deeper then lords of Waterdeep yet any more difficult to understand the play style. It has much more depth also. I recommend playing Waterdeep first if you have yet to play worker placement games then step up to this game so you can really see it's simplicity and beauty.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">Wow!  I like this one!  Pure worker placement for individualized benefits along 4 tracks on individual player boards.  The interactions among the disparate elements mean there are a few different directions to pursue and you will always, ALWAYS want to do more than you can.  WHICH IS AWESOME!  I was a little concerned with some of the spots on the central board being generally more powerful than others up until I realized that the real balance is in the opportunity cost of taking these spots before other, even more desirable ones.  That is, getting extra workers for a round is nice up until it costs you the spot(s) you wanted to use them on.  WHICH IS AWESOME!  MORE TENSION AND A META GAME!  WOOT!  So yeah, there's all this potential for screwage and meta gaming and intrinsic balance via opportunity costs.  And there are a few personal choices to be made and they really are rather significant.  WHICH IS ALSO AWESOME!  Also, each game will be at least a little different via the different engineers used.  I wish there was a bit more replay value, but maybe there's an expansion or two lurking in the wings.  Or maybe the engineers are enough?  NEED MORE PLAYS!  Rating has the potential to go down (or up, I suppose) after more plays but I don't know that it will.  I *really* like this game!</comment>

Cualquiera lo puede jugar, pero jugarlo bien es otra historia.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="Poland">A wonderful, brain-burning worker placement offering you an interesting selection of ways for gaining points. A very clever heavy euro game.</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">Yet another worker placement game, but surprisingly fresh.  Not exactly sure what it is, but I enjoyed it a lot.  Not sure there is enough variety given the limited player interaction to hold my interest for long.  However, at the moment, it is an intriguing puzzle that I feel compelled to figure out!</comment>
    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United Kingdom">Superb game, nicely produced and extremely well balanced so that there is no obvious strategy which will win every time. Strategy can depend on turn order as well as what others do. A top game.</comment>

The game mechanics are really simple and easy to lern ( Worker Placment), but you have so many options and different strategies its incredible. All you want is play this game over and over again.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="United States">Helluva a who-dun-it game. I am super jealous of my plays. And since there are are only 10 cases, only a select few are invited to play with me.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Spain">Not as good as Gumshoe but very, very close. Streamlined the game mechanics a bit but the setting is charming and appealing. In any case I love it and would probalby buy every single expansion they came up with (sadly and surprisingly they are not yet thinking about translating them to english)  Wish this concept became more popular and games like thin one started to flow. Try it out, you won&#180;t regret it.</comment>

    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Netherlands">Excellent deduction game from '81! This is not a boardgame in the common sense (cards or dice or moves or boards) but a collection of 10 cases that the player(s) must solve by gathering clues, visiting people, searching the newspapers for hints, etc. For fans of deduction games, this is so far the best game I found on the topic. What's more important, during the 2-3 hours that you will spend on the case, you will actually feel that you're visiting people, interviewing, questioning, findings hints etc. </comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="United States">I would love to give this game a "10" but translation issues and some of the more obtuse mysteries get in the way sometimes.  It's an excellent gateway game for people who don't generally like board games.  Highly recommended despite some niggling issues.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Netherlands">Wow.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="England">Not really a game in the usual sense of the word, but as an exercise in deductive reasoning and research it is hard to beat.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="">I prefer this game as single-player experience. Ive tried it as a coop and it didn't quite work for us. As a choose your own adventure-type activity, though, I enjoy it greatly. One of my favorites.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="United Kingdom">Really enjoyable game, it plays so nice as a co-op game. Can't recommend it highly enough.</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Brazil">This game is awesome, I enjoy deduction and investigation games very much, this game deserves a 10 rating, it got a 9 only because the lack of replayability, but in every other aspects this game is amazing, and I don't see the replayability of this game a huge problem since the game is made to be the way it is.</comment>

    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Russia">What an awesome game! Enjoyed every moment while playing it. There's only one thing REALLY annoying about it - too many misprints, not even in names or words but in directories! I lost one case because of the misprints, had to check every directory twice after that. Someone should be punished for this!!!</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Australia">The most thematic game I've ever played. Always feels like a treat playing one of these.  CT:theme  DP10</comment>
    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="England">Yeah, it has no replay value. Buy it anyway. It's a brilliant experience that will rough you up the wrong way if you don't appreciate Holmes' wacky deductive skills. A game like this lives or dies on its writing, and the writing here is stellar: thematic, engaging and ultimately very fun. If you make the right call as lead detective when others doubt you, it will feel brilliant.</comment>

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">This is currently my wife and my favorite two player game. We play with the 3-player setup, and it works fantastic. We get the satisfaction of "building" a castle, and most of our games have come down to just a few point swings. Admittedly, the game can suffer from analysis paralysis, and in 3 and 4 player games, there can be a lot of downtime between Master Builder turns. But, each turn, you are watching others build their castle, buy rooms that you want, and agonizing over under/overpricing something. The auction mechanic is neat, and the room variety is great. Add in the randomization of each set-up, and not knowing if you'll get what you want, and you have a very engaging board game experience. The only reason it's not a 10 in my book is the scoring track. Snake tracks aren't that great - but I don't have a solution otherwise. Great game - I'm always up for playing this.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">One of our Favorites, has gone over well with many skill levels.  Some players get stuck at the bid process in choosing order.. I find that part very fun and engaging.  It makes me care about other people's castle, and I get joy out of gambling how much I can get someone to pay me. </comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="Canada">Building awesome castles is great! Love this game and can't wait to check out the expansion</comment>

    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">Everybody likes it. It's a fun game. I really enjoy building the castles. The design is so smooth. It's hard for me to pick out flaws. It only lacks a little bit of 'oomph' in the strategy department. I would appreciate some more depth or interesting complexity. But it's an excellent game for what it's doing.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">this one is pretty great. the sense of creation as your castle takes shape is fantastic and though it seems like whomever gets the most workshops is going to win in an otherwise tight game (the randomness of the bonus cards is a bit irritating) it's still a fun experience the entire way through</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="">I really love this game not just for the fact that you're making totally crazy and implausible castles, but I love the spatial challenge involved. The auctioning and price setting mechanics can be a bit tricky to get at first, but the game is great fun with lots of replay value through the goals. It's different enough from Suburbia for me that I would play them both.</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United Kingdom">Very neat game; lots of choices and combos; fun</comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">Revising my rating of this game a bit upward. It just hits all the sweet spots I like. I need more multi-player time with it, but the strategy is just complex and intricate and really delightful. I NEED the expansion when it releases.  Edit: 7/30/15 - Really think the solitaire version is more luck-based than strategic. Sure there's strategy involved, and it helps to be on the lookout for good Outdoor Food tiles, and even that nice Utility room, but if you get some bum bonus cards, and then your tiles are not optimal, you're toast.  </comment>
    <comment game="Castles of Mad King Ludwig" game_id="155426" location="United States">This game is awesome, and original. I love how the theme ties into the actual King Ludwig II who built extravagant castles to the point they took him as mad for all the money he put into building castles.  I will say.......this game is ANALYSIS PARALYSIS prone!!!!!! Be careful who you play with !!!! Do NOT play with ppl who have a hard time making decisions!</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="Colombia">Is great when you beat it for the first time in the highest difficulty, everybody stand up, cheers and hugs, somebody may drop a small tear. But when you do it for the 3rd, 4th, 5th time..... it isn't that fun any more. Is great to introduce new players though.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="Thailand">Great co-op game that really fosters interaction and discussion.  </comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United Kingdom">Rating after watching 1 game and playing 2. Fantastic!  Easy to learn, compelling, fun, co-operative without 1 player dominating, great balance, excellent ability to make the game more difficult, edge of the seat tension, "we'd have won if only.....", quick to play, "lets play again"-ness, cheap, cheering on the viruses!  What more could you want in a boardgame?</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">My favourite co-op game. It is fun and quick. You can play with two or up to four. Technically, you can even play with five (without the expansion), but the game gets much much harder.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">With the On the Brink expansion, this is a wonderful game.  Without it, it is still pretty good.  My rating is for with the expansion.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Always different, Pandemic provides a challenging experience every time. It works with any number of players (one to four, albeit with a different feel with each option), and it is a decent solitaire option.  The "On The Brink" expansion adds a fifth player and several new roles and game play options. Still a fantastic hit!</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Really interesting co-op game. It is really easy to understand, and has many possibilities... We tried two times to played in heroic, but was really complicated, and the cooperation and group analysis make the game really depth... Great..</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">My favorite co-op ever. Maybe my favorite game ever. Great teamwork element, the stress piles up quickly, and wins are often eeked out at the last moment. Must have for any game shelf.  I have owned this game for nearly 7 years now. Still love it. That's saying something.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Our first cooperative board game. It was a hit; however we have played it so often we are burned out on it.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">For a game without complicated rules the theme is very catchy.  Replayable due to the nifty mechanism of starting infected cities and variable roles.  Hard to win with just one brain--often does take collaboration to see the path to victory.  </comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="Brazil">Jogo cooperativo puro fant&#225;stico! Acho que pode ser a porta de entrada perfeita para novos jogadores.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic" game_id="30549" location="United States">Well, I have finally found a co-op game that I enjoy! Pandemic does it for me because it is short, and because it is hard.

    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">Descent is D&amp;D after it has dropped the pretense that it has anything to do with role playing. It is all about the hack and slash on a board with beautiful production value. What isn't to like about Descent? It is a great dungeon crawl simulater where one player takes on the role of the GM and 4 others take on the role of an adventuring party on a quest. The game comes with plenty enough quests for a campaign and there is a lot of support for it. The only real drawbacks are that it requires more of a long term committment than I can reasonably expect from my regular game night which is more geared to multiple games every night and different ones each week and that it can take a toll to always be one player who does a lot of set up and prep work versus four others who are required to be invested over a long period of time. I've been playing around with the idea of having a home descent night for a campaign some time...</comment>
    <comment game="Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)" game_id="104162" location="United States">This game improves on the first edition so heavily that I don't think I would be able to accurately describe it. It's faster to play, there's more depth to the heroes, the minis are more detailed, the Overlord can win without taking any of the fun away from the heroes, there are more mechanics and more varied winning conditions, the tiles are double sided with outside  locations so you're effectively getting 48 dungeon tiles and 48 forest tiles, and the game isn't weighed down with all the unnecessary things the first one was (like the set-up time - the tiles are numbered and lettered, there are no tokens for holes and rocks, and there's an easier way to keep track of money rather than piling up the coins). It's far superior and utterly replaced the first edition for me, PHENOMENAL game!</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">Awesome game. Excellent bits and board, very immersive. It is probably my favorite 2-player game, and it is THE definitive Lord of the Rings game. If you want an epic Lord of the Rings gaming experience, this game cannot be beat.  During the game, both players must allocate their actions between the fellowship of the ring (either finding them or getting them to Mordor) and the War between the Free Peoples and the Shadow. Each nation has their own miniatures and the cards do a very good job of reenacting situations (or possible situations) from the books. The action dice are a cool part of the game that can force you to alter your strategy a bit, but still gives you a ton of choices.  I love the full game, but also enjoy a variant on the intro game I made that cuts out the cards (thus, cutting play time in half) and is more balanced than the original (broken) quick-play rules. </comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">The re-telling of the War for Middle Earth with every play. Theme, theme, theme. The 3-point fonts on muddy card backgrounds is one drawback. For me the other gripes people have are legitimate, but not too much of a problem for me. I have a defective board, but that doesn't hinder the enjoyment a bit.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United Kingdom">This is a classic and the only game that I painted its minis. It took me months but I enjoyed it. I will never do it again ever but my experience with playing with painted minis is vastly enhanced. Now about the game, it is grandiose, ambitious, deep and really long but I love it, the 2nd edition rules are a very good upgrade. Rules are complex with many, many exceptions, your first games will take 3-4 hours minimum with most of the time reading the rulebook but it is very rewarding and the theme is all a LOTR fan could ask for.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="Philippines">Awesome, thematic, epic game. Takes a long time to set up, takes a long time to explain, takes a long time getting used to the game... but it's all worth it. </comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="">I played this game several times now and I find it an absolutely great game. The victory condition to bring the Fellowship to Mount Doom to destroy the ring or to win by victory points makes this game outstanding. Especially the event cards gives this game a wonderful atmosphere. However I am giving it a 9 for the "simple" combat system.   </comment>

The downloadable extras that allow you to separate the pieces by type w/o painting them really help speed up setup time. I wish I could find more time to play this beautiful game!</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">This game does a great job of capturing the theme and spirit of the story while not going down the slippery slope of being scripted. All of the elements you'd expect to be in the game are there and then some but you are free to rewrite 'history' or follow the same path. There are so many options available to both players that I doubt the game will play out the same way twice. Sure, there are several seemingly sure fire overall strategies that are mentioned a lot but even if both players try the same strategy twice they will always be different since the cards are such a significant part of how the game unfolds. Lots of choices and tension all the way through to the end. The corruption buildup at the end of the game seems a little harsh on the Fellowship but I guess that's really the way it should be otherwise it would seem too easy! Overall, a solid game that I'd play almost anytime if I had the time.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (first edition)" game_id="9609" location="United States">If you want to relive the LoTR saga and see how things could have turned out differently then play this game. WoTR really captures the essence of the book while at the same time allowing you to change the story line.  The rulebook is long and complex, and the text on the cards is way too small If you are a LORT fan this game may be for you. Beware, it can easily take 4-6 or more hours to play.</comment>

    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="">Fantastic game for a large group (6+). I can see how this might not work if people are reluctant to lie about their identities, but most folks warm up to the game pretty quickly.   It's a 9 for me, and much better than Werewolf or Mafia where people get eliminated early on. I would recommend the  Avalon version over the base game.</comment>

It was one of the most rewarding experiences, and proves to me that this game gets better with repetition.  That's not a quality many games share.</comment>
    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="Austria">I don't usually enjoy social deduction games, but this is for sure the best one I've played so far. My biggest complaint about this kind of game is the usual absence of a solid mechanic beneath all the talking, lying and bluffing... which makes the game-play too intangible - so to speak - for me, since the players can only rely on their ability to read other people's faces.  The Resistance is different, even if it's still really simple and straight-forward. The key to its trick is the addition of the voting phase, because it really allows to read the other players's intentions and brings a huge deal of discussion to the table every time. This simple mechanic makes the game very deep and interesting! I also like the fact that all the players are involved at all times... unlike Werewolf, a game which is often compared to Resistance, where players are killed off turn by turn.  The Resistance is a really great game... and one I'm growing more fond of play after play. The Avalon version introduces some really cool roles, that make thing even more interesting and even more tense! Finally I've found the social deduction game that I enjoy. Huge thumbs up for me!</comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="Canada">A game of set rounds set in the city of Troyes and utilizing a very unique dice action selection mechanism.  Each round you gather a die (the die have different colours and can be used for different regions of the board, religious, civil, and military) for each person you have in one of 3 different cities and roll them.  These dice will be used to perform several different actions: make money, add presence to the cathedral (scores points and influence), fight the marauders (scores points and influence), add more people to cities (therefore get more dice and thus more actions later), add people to building cards (scores end game points and allows access to a wide variety of abilities).  There are a couple of interesting twists with the dice selection: you can purchase other people's die, thereby taking their actions for your own in essence, you can also re-roll or "flip" bad rolls into good ones paying with influence (another currency effectively).  Therefore you can win with lots of dice or little, with "bad" rolls or good ones.  Money is tight, so passing is another option and you generate income this way similar in fashion to the Amyitis.  Each round you also have to as a group, fight the marauders to a limited extent and quite likely weather the storm of their attacks (some negative penalties)- it therefore gives incentive to the action of fighting the marauders.  Each player is secretly assigned an end game point-scoring character card (based on end game conditions) that all players can potentially score for so you need to keep an eye on what other players are focusing on.    This game scales very well from 2-4 players and has alot of moving parts and is truly a strategy gamer's game.  Own the [boardgame=94284]bonus cards[/boardgame] and the [boardgame=127061]Ladies of Troyes[/boardgame] expansion.  The Ladies of Troyes expansion adds the following (which can be modular if you wish): a purple die for each player which cannot be purchased and which can be used as ANY colour, there are 3 new end game persons, there is a variant rule for adding an additional person face up for all players to be able to target for scoring, there are several new building and marauding cards, and there are the outdoor activities.  The outdoor activities allow for a new action which is the movement of your tower guard around the castle and when he reaches an activity, he has access to it which provides abilities and/or scoring opportunities- this action is very useful and powerful and should not be overlooked.  The expansion does not contain alot of materials but it increases the variability and replayability of an already great game so I definitely recommend it.</comment>

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="Australia">My favourite Euro. Luck plays its part in the die rolls - as it should - but not so much that it can make victory impossible.

    <comment game="Troyes" game_id="73439" location="United States">Very interested in playing this more to fully explore the design. Won my initial game at BGG.CON (a squeaker!) and absolutely love the decisions surrounding the use of dice. It seems best to think of dice not as your own in the sense that you are going to get to use them, but rather as potential, either for cheap dice placement or for gold when people pay you to use them.   Ladies is an interesting expansion, I didn't think I was actually going to like the purple die as it seemed like it would rob the game of some tension, but it actually allows for some measure of interesting decisions, and all the additional cards are great (e.g. I think trebuchet is a much more balanced card than archers). Doubling the potential scoring categories makes for a much more tense finish, some in the group have expressed that it makes it feel a little too much like a crapshoot, and I can agree to some degree, but it also means you REALLY need to pay attention to what everyone else is doing.</comment>

    <comment game="A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)" game_id="103343" location="Poland">We played three times in a row, as some people were saying they played 'nice' and that is why they did not win. As next games showed, it was luck which made them win and the 'girls power' still was significantly higher then the rest two players :) Amazing game flow, consistence and balance makes The Games of Thrones (2nd edition) one of the best games I played in 2011. Huge improvement comparing to the previous edition of the game.</comment>

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">O&amp;L reminds me of Le Havre and Roads &amp; Boats; it has a spatial component in terms of settlements (where as Le Havre only had the resource conversion) but it's abstracted away most of the logistics found in R&amp;B. Roads &amp; Boats takes me about 3.5 hrs and I find it takes about an hour too long, where as this routinely takes me around 3 and I have no issue with the length... Second, it has a more shallow resource conversion chain than R&amp;B (going from logs to stocks takes around 8 buildings plus movements) where as O&amp;L's complicated chains take around 4 or 5 actions/buildings.  Design-wise, it checks a lot of boxes that I like; wide decisions that I wrestle with (especially late game where there are upwards of 30 possible things I could do each turn). Opportunistic resource conversion and action taking, and some long term spatial planning with the settlements. If it had a randomized setup for buildings (e.g. a new expansion that you dealt in half of each game) then it would be a solid. The lack of a fixed end 8 rounds after D in 2p mode is sort of perplexing though and one of the few variants I employ if I have to play it 2p (although, I almost never do).  It also has a bunch of things that I actively dislike about euro games. It's a static setup/play, it doesn't have a lot of interaction (in fact, I've won games basically ignoring most of what other players are doing and instead only ensuring they can't buy the buildings I'm after), and while it is a sandbox of sorts, there are really only a couple patterns for building your settlements in and playing the game sometimes is just a matter of working on the margins of actions and the resource conversions (which are a minority of the point totals). This is true after 5-10 plays and everyone understands how the resources will convert and buildings are scored. It has a fiddly setup (like Bohnanza) where you change what's in the game and how the game is sort of played based on the player count.  I do think it's Uwe's best game, and I still think it's a 9, but it might be my weakest 9.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Canada">A combination of Le Havre, Farmers of the Moor, and new but very Rosenberg-like gameplay.  This game is essentially a worker placement point-grab fest, where you use your workers on your own board area, which you can develop and build up in a somewhat different manner each game.  Actions consist of: 1) grab resources by placing a worker in a building, 2) build a building, 3) grab resources (wood or peat) by clearing your forests or swamps on your play area.  Money can be used to purchase additional landscape tiles as a free action, and it can also be used to hire another player's workers to make them place in their own buildings to generate the resources for you, which can lead to some interesting blocking situations.  There are few ways to score points: 1) building settlements, which are built using food and energy and score points based on their connectivity to other buildings and settlements, 2) built buildings, which provide points, potential settlement points, and special abilities, 3) building wonders, which are like build point buildings with no special function, and 4) accumulating resources that have point values (such as whiskey, gold, etc.).  Unlike most of Rosenberg's games, there is no stress of a "harvest", however you do need to keep up with the neighbours building settlements otherwise you will likely be out the game with respect to points.  The game plays 1-4 players; I've played it 2 and 3 and it scales well, but its a long game and I can't see playing with 4 players.  There do not seem to be any replayability issues whatsoever despite what many BGGers are complaining about; that said, the game does seem like its ripe for expansions and I would certainly welcome expansions.  This is definitely a gamer's game, in line with Rosenberg's other big box games, and its probably his second or third best design for me.

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Poland">2016-06-23 (rating 9):  Another excellent worker placement. What I really enjoy in this one is the building aspect that matters (in [gameid=31260] it doesn't...) and the rondel which saves a lot of maintenance.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Spain">Muy buen juego de gesti&#243;n de recursos, y de gestionar construcci&#243;n de territorio con cartas de edificios, que hacen combo o transforman los recursos. La idea de la rueda es MARAVILLOSA y facilita y agiliza el juego. El detalle de poder pagar a otro monje por hacerle una acci&#243;n suya le da un toque un poco m&#225;s interactivo. Probado a 4 y a 2, escala muy bien. En mi opini&#243;n, en plan gesti&#243;n de recursos, siguiendo la l&#237;nea del autor, este juego supera al Agr&#237;cola, (si bien es cierto que el agr&#237;cola tiene una variedad brutal con los mazos de profesiones y adquisiciones)</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">My favorite of the Rosenberg harvest series that I have played.  Certainly feels like a reimplementation of [I]Le Havre[/I] and, in my estimation, an improvement.  Glad to have purchased the 2015 reprint of this that comes with the upgraded [read: not substandard] components.  Very similar to [I]Le Havre[/I] with collecting resources on offer (which accumulate every round that they are not taken) and building buildings to convert/optimize those resources, but with the added twist that the buildings are being built on an [I]Agricola: Farmers of the Moor[/I] landscape (that is expandable to include mountains/coast/water, etc.), so a lot of planning goes into what types of terrain the buildings can be built on, and how those buildings are arranged around settlements that are built at defined intervals.  The mechanism for placing workers and taking those workers back adds some very interesting decisions and tension, which is a nice change from the pressure of just trying to meet regular feeding requirements.  I don't agree with the criticisms of the game that focus on its lack of variable setup.  The buildings in the game come out in predefined groups, but this is not all that dissimilar from [I]Le Havre[/I] where one typically sees the Clay Mound, or the Cokery, or the Ironworks enter the game at roughly the same stages in the vast majority of games (true, [I]Le Havre[/I] does include a limited number of "Special Buildings" that change from game to game, but I've never seen a winning strategy built around them, partially because there is only one or two optimal paths to take in [I]Le Havre[/I]).  With both the Ireland and France variants in [I]Ora et Labora[/I] plus the seemingly much more varied paths to victory, plus the interesting scoring opportunities based on dwelling values, I think there is enough opportunity for different-feeling games--though it is true that unimaginative gamers may get trapped into doing the exact same thing every single game, if only because it is theoretically possible to do so.  </comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Finland">I liked that there was no Agricola like food mechanism that would take half of time. This gave more free hands. Rondel system was convinient. I think this could be best with 2 players. After that playtime increases and also you can't keep track what others have as well.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Canada">My daughter is fantastic at this game!</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">A brilliant game with a very pleasant theme. The settlement value scoring injects a refreshing spatiality to an otherwise typical Uwe Rosenberg resource management/building game. Lots of possibilities to explore!</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Germany">Now this is one elegant design. Uwe again. I really have to play this again ASAP. But i really enjoyed it the few times i played it.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">1-4(3)  I'm not too much a fan of Loyang, and I haven't bothered (so far) with Merkator, but this really was a great game. It did feel quite a bit like Le Havre, with just a touch of Farmers in the Moor. I think the work contracts are an interesting, if light, bit of interaction (though hiring an opponent's prior can ruin their plans). There is indeed a very wide decision space, including with landscapes and layout and everything else. It's also pretty satisfying to see your monastery at the end of a session.  I do still wish there were some variability. Not that the game needs it ... as I said the decision space is pretty huge ... but because it would potentially create interesting and different dynamics. As in, in certain sessions certain resources and buildings will be in particular demand. This is similar to the building arrangements in Le Havre. The wharf will come out at a different time each session, but you know when it will come out. Early wharf games will play very differently than late wharf games (or other buildings, but notably the wharf can affect the game dynamic most dramatically). I do find this sort of variability really refreshing.  I can understand that perhaps Uwe has tuned the game very specifically to this fixed setup and I think I'll like it just fine as it is. Do I like it more than Le Havre? Potentially. I can understand that people feel it's too similar to Le Havre, and I get some of that feeling myself. They play in maybe about the same time and have very similar game dynamics, but I could see playing either one. Le Havre feels much more rich with resources. Ora &amp; Labora isn't tight, but doesn't blow up like Le Havre.  Do I like it better than Agricola? The setup in O&amp;E is cumbersome, but not Agricola cumbersome. Really, Agricola's still great, though, with great great tension and great variability in the cards and such. All three are 10s, and I'm always up to play, if we have the time.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Greece">Another great eurogame from Mr Rosenberg. The game feels a lot like Le Havre because of the many (10+) different resources that you can collect and later transform to another 10+ products. The rules are very simple and the 'meat' of this game is in the buildings. There are many of them each with unique abilities.  So what's new in Ora et Labora??  First of all I like that you now have your own land spaces where you can build things. The whole 'where to put each building in order to maximize the bonus points' problem feels like a small puzzle to me and I like solving puzzles. I also like the visual image of my monastery growing slowly turn after turn.   The worker placement mechanic is also upgraded with each player having 3 workers one of them with a cool ability to imediately go and activate the building that you just bought. Also you can mess with other players by using their meeples on their buildings. Oh and the big wheel that keeps track of the resources is simply genious!  The only negative is that the cards are small but to be honest it was neccasary in order to keep the playing area in logical dimensions.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">This is a big heavy-hitter from Rosenberg. First, the theme: I love being able to play as a group of monks attempting to create the richest and most prestigious diocese in Ireland/France. As a sincere Christian with a soft spot for monastic writers, and as a long-established homebrewer, the idea of making wine, beer, and whisky in a cloister is pretty fantastic. The game play makes a lot of sense as you are attempting to organize the countryside surrounding your monastery in the best way possible. True to life, most monastic communities caused villages and whole cities to spring up around them, though they were founded in the wilderness.  As the more refined brother of Le Havre, this game is all about resource conversion. The resource wheel is a savvy way to keep track of what is available from basic production, but the real meat of the game is balancing the abilities of various building to manipulate the inventory you keep during the game. Split into four phases, the pacing of the game really emulates the slow-but-eventually-exponential growth of monastic influence. Early on, you're scraping together fuel and food in order to accommodate simple settlements to move in near the cloister, but eventually you're buying huge swaths of real estate, cracking out ecclesiastical relics, ornate stonework, and fine alcoholic beverages, in addition to building ever grander structures like castles, palaces, and sacristies. The scope of the game is massive.   Player interaction can get pretty cutthroat as you have the ability to pay your opponents to use their own workers, effectively blocking their actions and taking advantage of the leg-work they invested to build up their own player boards. This reminds me of Keyflower in a way.   Overall, this a great game. The wow factor is there. I also really enjoy the solo puzzle of this one--in that regard, it far outstrips Agricola.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="Denmark">While Agricola and Le Havre both are fantastic games, his last two (At the Gates of Loyang &amp; Merkator) were disappointments. Ora et Labora certainly isn't.   The game play is very resemblant of Le Havre. It revolves around using building most efficiently and gathering ressources at the right time. Some might say it actually is Le Havre without the feeding phase and with a ressource-rondel instead of ressource-spaces. In any case a great game! This could easily reach the top 20 of BGG.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Played 4P long game, 2P short game x2, and 3P long game.  Try as I may, I can't come up with a Eurogame that comes close on the 2P experience.  Agricola is my all-time favorite board game, and I only kinda like Le Havre.  I feel like this is a mature and FOTM-influenced Le Havre.  Didn't insta-buy a copy because of the well-known production issues, which I hope are resolved with a reprint.  With 25 turns, even a couple of minutes per turn per player can make this run extremely long with 3P and 4P.  I don't even mind it taking forever, but I do mind downtime.  Will check out the 3P and 4P short games.  Update: played a couple 2P games back-to-back and a bit of the shine wore off.  Ireland was a bit too forgiving for both of us, France had some serious point loops (wine for districts, then score districts) which made it so that only one player wanted to end the game while the other caught up.  And I'm growing a bit more concerned about the static starting positions.  Still, picked up the second printing and got a perfect copy.  And I'm still very happy to play it 2P.</comment>
    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Insanely deep yet easy to understand.  First playthrough goes slow but once you get the hang of it that typical euro "Oh, wow" kicks in.  Can't wait to play more!</comment>

    <comment game="Ora et Labora" game_id="70149" location="United States">Now with the updated 2015 printing, this game has components that match the high quality of gameplay. Like many Uwe Rosenberg's game, players are converting goods multiple times in order to score VP. But to do this, players use their workers (3 per player) to build/use buildings. But there is a catch, players only get their workers back if they place all of them. And one worker (the prior) can be used automatically when building a building. Thus, players attempt to place their workers efficiently by having them all placed before the end-of-the-round and only placing buildings when the prior is available.   Compared to other Uwe Rosenberg's game, this game doesn't feel as confrontational/mean as Agricola. And because of the rondel mechanism, which gradually increases the number of basic goods/money per round, there always seems something worthwhile to grab. But this game isn't solitaire. Players are able to hire other players' workers and use their builders. And like most worker placement games, if a building is occupied, you can't use it. Thus, players have to contend not only with the race element (grabbing resources) but the prospect of other players' disruptive actions.   There is more to this game. For instance, there is an abstract scoring element with how buildings are scored at the end of the game. But basically, if you like euro-games and you like resource conversion/management, this is a game you should strongly look at.</comment>
    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="United Kingdom">Based on 1 play. I liked it.  Nice and simple to learn, but lots of hidden depth, plus risk/gambling!

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="Canada">IMO it doesn't hold a candle to Lords of Waterdeep, but its a lighter and quicker change of pace. The game grows and me and we enjoy the expansion. Up'd my rating from 8 to 9. </comment>

Following two more plays this goes up to an 8, assuming that most of the play is with family and irregular gamers. Very attractive for these two groups - lots going on with everyone involved and they love the dice rolling. It's also great that it isn't always clear who is winning. A good addition to the collection and recommended.</comment>
    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="Canada">This game is almost as good as it gets for me.  I loooove worker-placement games and, although this one is not necessarily on the meatier end of those ones, I don't think that's a bad thing though.  It's a beautiful game, perhaps the best looking game in my collection, and the leather dice cup is definitely my favourite game accessory. </comment>

The action selection in this game is brilliant, and provides the bulk of the tension. You want to delay, delay, delay, but sometimes there are things you NEED to do NOW. In 2p the map doesn't fill up particularly full, with 3p we saw all the companies earnestly in play, but because companies get to keep 4 dollar columns safe, we had 3 $4/share companies and 1 $8/share company. It would be very interesting indeed if this protection didn't exist. But still, the game is incredible. The first time you manage to move up like 6 books in a single bookkeeping action, you'll agree with me.</comment>

    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Canada">Love the combination of hand building/management, worker placement and the company growth via area control.  Another game with lots of rewards and has a nice building feeling as you do more and more later in the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="">Schon das erste Testspiel hat gezeigt, was f&#252;r ein Potential hier schlummert. Kommt mir pers&#246;nlich noch gelungener als Russian Railroads vor.</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Canada">An excellent, deep deck building game with a discard pile management twist. It reminds me a bit of Lewis &amp; Clark; where L&amp;C focussed on advancement on a single race track, Mombasa is about progression along 6 "stock" tracks (4 companies + diamond exploration + book research).</comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Belgium">Great game, difficult to find the right tactic but with many depths. After the first game, you think about how to play it the next time. It's a good thing if you want try it again only because you will find the right method of winning. As long as there is no winner's system, it will stay good.</comment>

    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="United States">Whatever type game mechanic you want, Mombasa has it. Worker placement, area control, deckbuilding, set collection, slightly combat, bidding...you name it. IT DOES IT ALL AMAZINGLY WELL. It's wonderfully balanced. SO many options. SO much strategy. SO much fun for euro fans.  The bad? The instruction manual is pretty bad. It takes 45 minutes to an hour just to explain the rules. But, once you "get" it you got it. And once you've gotten it...it is absolutely fantastic!</comment>

Pfister has delivered! The Diamonds way is much easier to follow as the Way of books to go. So a bit expanding and some mines could be the path to victory?  </comment>
    <comment game="Mombasa" game_id="172386" location="Spain">Una delicia de juego... dura siete turnos. En cada turno, el jugador escoge jugar una serie de cartas, que le van a permitir hacer acciones (aumentar en un track, comprar cartas, explorar, o colocar trabajadores).  En el juego hay cuatro "empresas" y a cada una de ellas corresponde un track. Cuando avanzas por ese track vas ganando "acciones" de dicha empresa. Con la acci&#243;n de explorar, se van consiguiendo cosas y despejando una zona con "casitas" de dicha empresa, que van desvelando monedas, que al final de la partida ser&#225;n el valor de cada acci&#243;n conseguida de esa empresa (multiplicadores). Cada jugador posee adem&#225;s un tablero para los diamantes y los libros... cada uno de esos items, se refleja en un track que tambi&#233;n otorgar&#225; puntos al final de la partida. Lo m&#225;s llamativo es la planificaci&#243;n que requiere de las cartas a utilizar y c&#243;mo utilizarlas, porque al final de cada turno, cada carta pasa a una pila de descartes diferente despu&#233;s de que el jugador haya escogido una de las pilas para a&#241;adir a su mano. Es un m&#233;todo original y que aporta mucho quebradero de cabeza al juego. Muy, muy interesante, pero s&#243;lo para jugones. A la altura de Troyes o Bruxelles. Una joyita, vamos.</comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Romania">I really like this game. It has no luck, the board is done in a way that everyone stays the same distance to everyone, which is really good I think. The miniatures are good, the game play is not long either. </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">I REALLY enjoy this game and it always crosses my mind as one I would like to get back to the table.  That being said, I'm not sure who exactly I could play this with - maybe dad and Wesley at some point. </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">My favorite "war game" even if it only plays in under an hour.  I like that it completely penalizes defensive play and encourages attacking!</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">It's like Risk, but without all the shitty, slow, defensive bits.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="">5 players may be too many. The once we tried it was painfully long.  3 or 4 players is great.  Encourages aggressive play. So many routes to victory that it's difficult to imagine ever tiring of this game.   Play time: 2.5 - 3 hours.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="">This is an absolutely beautiful and superb game. With only a few minor glitches on cards, Kemet sports one of the highest component qualities I've ever seen in a game. The gameplay itself is highly strategic and requires really having a future game plan that's semi flexible. The plastic models are all very cool and each army is different looking. Play remains symmetrical, though the balance in the game is superb enough that it never gets boring. There isn't a single bad thing you can say about this game.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">Great Game. I am more of a Euro player but this game is all about attack and I still love it.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">One of the best dudes-on-a-map games of recent age: aggressive and easy to learn, with tons of options to buff your armies and a huge amount of table-talk and general murdering.  It's a satisfying affair all around, made better by the fact that it doesn't overstay its welcome and the components are absolute best-in-class.  An easy winner in the group, though one that doesn't see a ton of play yet.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="New Zealand">Components are good but the monster miniatures are a stand out. The tech tree is really cool with so many different choices that you can develop your strategy around. Attacking is encouraged right from turn one. Needs player aids for the tech tiles. Would prefer dice for combat but the cards work. </comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="">LIKES:  - power tiles add an infinite number of awesome combinations and options - artwork and components are fantastic (especially the box art) - different sculpts for each player's units - no dice to roll - very fun and aggressive gameplay - meaty strategic choices regarding claiming victory points versus keeping them from your opponents - combat is driven by card/tile combos - two sides of the board to keep gameplay balanced at all player counts - looks like Ameritrash, but plays more like a Euro - a nice sense of scale between the smaller units and the creatures  DISLIKES:  - takes awhile to set up</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">An excellent mythological war game with simple rules but a lot of strategy involved. The presentation is beautiful, about the only complaint I have is negative space on the lesser # player side of the board, but I imagine that balances out on the flip side. Fun stuff.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United Kingdom">most innovative game I've ever tried. best game in my collection so far. I have tried it with both 2 and 3 players and I liked it with both counts i prefer it better with two. deduction mixed with worker placement. very very nice</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United Kingdom">Gave a 9 after the first play. I want to give it 10 but while it's been a blast so far I'm not 100% convinced it's an evergreen.  I did wonder whether the deduction side would become a routine exercise after several plays and become less engaging, and not everyone will enjoy the possibility of your whole game tumbling down if you mess it up, but for me these two things counteract each other. I just find it ridiculously fun and exciting. And once people start publishing... for a thinky Euro this game has drawn the most trash talk out of our group outside of The Resistance. But of a different flavour. "That can't be right! Someone debunk this garbage!" "Oh, but it is right. I think it is YOU who should check your working..." (aside: this is mostly my fault because in the first game I thought it'd be a good idea to rush grants with dodgy research, not realising how the end-game scoring worked...) </comment>

Detective alqu&#237;mico xD. Y tambi&#233;n de adelantarte a los planes de los contrarios, o fastidiarles demostrando sus errores en sus publicaciones XD  Con la mezcla de 2 ingredientes, creas pociones, que las puedes vender a aventureros, d&#225;rselas a probar a tus becarios xD, o beb&#233;rtelas t&#250; mismo para ver cuales son sus efectos, y con todo ello ir publicando teor&#237;as sobre los ingredientes o refutar las teor&#237;as de otros, para ganar como alquimista reputaci&#243;n o hac&#233;rsela perder a otro xD. Tambi&#233;n puedes comprar objetos m&#225;gicos que dar&#225;n ventajas y/o puntos de victoria que junto a la reputaci&#243;n, las teor&#237;as correctas y las becas que hubieras conseguido, determinar&#225;n el ganador.

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">Mind blowing.  Incredibly steep learning curve, requires heavy deduction (some people will not be able to handle it!)  Artwork is fantastic.  Player screens are the most amazing player screens ever.    The game does an amazing job of capturing the theme.   It should be stressed that the learning curve is very harsh, and your first game is very much just a learning experience, and you need to give a thorough tutorial on how the alchemy laws work before playing.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">I love this game because it's a great and unique mix of worker placement, resource management, and deduction. The use of the smartphone app to run the game is fun, and not seen in many other games. I've never seen any other game like it, and the potion mixing and deduction mechanics make it really special. The potion academia theme also tickles my fancy too. There's a higher-than-average learning curve to figuring out how the deduction works, but when you get it, the game is truly brilliant.</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">Very fun game. The companion app works great. Wouldn't play the game without the app. This is definitely a brain burning deduction game with worker placement. If you screw up on identifying the different potions it can be really hard to recover. This can result in some AP. This game will really give your brain a workout so plan on playing something lighter after playing this one. PROS: app, deduction aspect, worker placement choices. CONS: hard to recover if you make the wrong deductions.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">Super thinky deduction game. Be careful to read your chart correctly, or it will screw you. </comment>

Only docked a point due to the shoddy way the cards were shrink-wrapped, and how much time it took to organize, along with reports of missing cards.  This has replaced Dominion for me, I believe. </comment>

    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="France">I love coop, I love deck building, and I like the theme. Legendary encounters weaves all three aspects flawlessly. Even better than Legendary marvel !</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Wow. This is pretty much everything you could want from a co-op deck builder. The base mechanics have been altered to create a feel that matches the Alien theme perfectly.  The designers really went above and beyond to capture the essence of the movie experience. As a fan of the system and the films, this is an incredible experience packed into 45&#8211;60 minutes of game play!</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Andrea loves Alien, so this is a fun one for us. We like to watch the movies while we play the game to create the suspense and horror!</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">The Alien Anthology in a box. Upper Deck delivers an awesome experience in this Alien themed gamed using their deck building system from Marvel Legendary. While it plays similar to Marvel you get a very different feel and the theme is far more immersive. It plays in about the same amount of time but due to the graphic nature of the artwork we wouldn't advise playing this with anyone under 13.   Really looking forward to expansions for this. Predators? Prometheus? Sure hope so!</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">A great addition to the Legendary series.  Plays quite differently than "Legendary Marvel," with the addition of roles, hidden agendas (possible traitors), and hidden enemies.  You have to scan for the aliens (by attacking their locations) before you can attack them.  Really *great* theme.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Germany">My first deck builder and its a blast!</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="United States">Seems like a jumbled mess when you first open the box, but then as you organize it and actually play it, you realize it's not...definitely an excellent adaptation of the Legendary system to embrace the theme of these beloved movies. Tense, frightening, lots of ways to vary up the play, whether you go straight through the movies or just mix and match objectives and characters. The added quirks like the 'Scan' mechanic rule, or the Chestbursters that get mixed into your deck when you fail to kill off a Facehugger; and there is always that uncertainty of what you drew from the Drone deck to mix with your Hives...amazing, really. I brushed it off at first but I am so glad I didn't in the end, because it is amazing.</comment>
    <comment game="Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game" game_id="146652" location="Czech Republic">The best deck-building, the best cooperative and the best solo experience I've had playing any game. I don't know anyone who wouldn't like the game after playing it once. Legendary system put into perfection. Legendary Marvel will always be more popular but it's not nearly as good. Legendary Predator is somewhere between. I have high hopes for Alien expansion and for Legendary Firefly.</comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">I highly enjoy the multiplayer variant, and moderately enjoy playing Nations solo. The game is complex enough -- and luck-less enough -- to reward skill and thought. There are many ways to win, and tactics can change quickly over the course of a game. Both long-term thinking and flexible, tactical reactions are rewarded. Plus, whether you're winning or losing at any given time, it's important to stay on your toes, because it's not game over until it's officially over. Comebacks are possible. Additionally, the nuanced A/B sides of the player nations and the varying cards based on skill added a second degree of depth worthy of applause. I found solo play to be a bit easy, and playing for the sake of points isn't as fun as playing for survival/dominance. The "shadow opponent" doesn't think, so it's probably a bit too easy to outmaneuver. However, it's still fun overall. </comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Spain">Una pasada de juego, para los amantes de la microgesti&#243;n, recursos, y apurar puntos de victoria buscando las mejores v&#237;as posibles, y siempre con tensi&#243;n de ir teniendo los recursos justos. &#218;nico punto negativo: la caja GIGANTE, sobra aire de forma exagerada! Me gusta bastante m&#225;s que el TTA, empezando por la duraci&#243;n, consigue unas sensaciones muy parecidas, y no tienes la sensaci&#243;n de que alguna carta como l&#237;der o maravilla, ha descompensado totalmente el juego por estar muy OP y no hablemos de lo exagerado del TTA del militar y que te salga o no cierta carta de guerra que tambi&#233;n puede estar muy descompensada (que como ventaja tiene que eso le da al juego un toque de interacci&#243;n m&#225;s directa). Y te permite m&#225;s libertad y decisi&#243;n que las mejoras fijas de cartas del TTA por no hablar de el AHORRO BRUTAL de tiempo con la burocracia constante del ajuste de cubitos. En mesa, much&#237;simo mejor Nations, TTA siendo un buen juego (a pesar de las cartas OP), es la excepci&#243;n de que es mucho mejor online, quiz&#225; la nueva versi&#243;n mejore un poco el equilibrio, pero el resto ser&#225; mismo juego.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Germany">Weight: 4/5 Player: 1-5 (best: 2-?) Time: 40m per player  Summary: Best civilization worker placement game. It's big but still very streamlined without many tiny extra rules. However, I often forget to update the stability and military strength which you have to keep in mind while playing the game.  Unlike other worker placement games, each player here has a board own his own to place workers. Workers can be placed again and again as long as a player is able to spent the resources.  Players interact with other players by tracking their individual stability and military strength. There is also a race for buying new cards which come out each round., e. g., buildings, units, or wonders.</comment>

Un gran trabajo, echo de menos la expansi&#243;n por alg&#250;n tipo de mapa</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">A bit long for our first game, but it feels like a more streamlined version of TTA.  Rules are a bit confusing, but we had a lot of fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Poland">I will start by saying that Nations is not a civ building game but a euro-game. Despite the wars, the game is a fairly complex worker placement rewarding the player with the most flexible strategy, the one who can make the best use of the cards appearing each round. The military could be very well be called "resource" and it would not change the game at all, but this just proves that it's euro. It had the potential to be a 9.5 or even a 10, but it has two drawbacks - the wars which are simply punishing without affecting the strongest player (no catching up mechanism there) and some of the cards are way too powerful.   Nations remains one of the best games from Essen 2013 and it's high ratings and buzz are well deserved.  EDIT: Rating changed to 9.25 after 4 more games. Why? The game is faster than written on the box when you play with experienced players, I am rating it as a euro rather than a civ, the high replay value, no major imbalance.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Poland">The advantage of the first player is extremaly unballanced much more than in e.g. Caylus. Drawed Egyptians and was the last player in order of the first round. The first player built some soldiers than took colonies cheaply boosting his production than played a war so at the end of the first round we could say that the play is finished. Really frustrating :/ Newer saw the player who was as last in turn order as a winner until we modified the rules. Now we play this way that the second player takes a bonus 1 coin at the beginning, the third takes 2 coins etc. It neutralizes the cost of taking the card from the board and gives you some chcnces.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">This is one of those games where no matter how bad you do, you say immediately afterward "I wanna play again!".  The time commit is a bit steep to do that, but we all like the diversity of the progress cards and how each game feels different.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Israel">My favorite civilization building game. Maybe not as deep as Through the Ages, but much faster and easy to explain.</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Played it wrong the first time, but overall the gameplay was surprisingly pleasant.  Reasons why it is better than Through the Ages  #1 Player actions are spread out and it isn't one massive turn (speeds up the gameplay and significantly reduces downtime)  #2 Simplification - Not having to pay for buildings, much simpler war/raid rules, moving gold into civil actions (allows much more flexible turns since you can save these up from previous rounds), removing military actions.    #3 Newbie friendly - The "Growth" step allows people to recover from mistakes by getting the gold/food/ore that they might not have planned for previously.  Reasons why I still might play Through the Ages  #1 Less player interaction.  You can't directly attack players (this could in some ways also be seen as a plus)  #2 You will get to see all of the cards.  We had a significant issue where two players were effectively stuck in the stone age as it came to rock production because there were only two ore producing cards that came up, both which were taken by a single player.  In TtA, you can at least anticipate and know the # of items that will come up for each player  #3 Newbification - There is still something to be said about playing an epic game of TtA with hardcore boardgamers and being absolutely cutthroat.  </comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="Spain">Juegazo. Me apetece siempre y creo que es el juego al que m&#225;s he jugado si no de los que m&#225;s lo he hecho.  Es un placer evolucionar la civilizaci&#243;n. Cinco variables muy intrincadas entre s&#237; son los engranajes del juego: El dinero (nos permite comprar las cartas y garantizo problemas si no lo tienes), la piedra (nos permite emplazar trabajadores e incluso construir maravillas; aqu&#237; es d&#243;nde se reparten los puntos, de hecho, al &#250;ltimo turno hemos de llegar con piedra como para cambiar las pir&#225;mides de sitio), La comida (necesaria para abastecer a la civiliaci&#243;n), y los libros, con una doble funci&#243;n: comod&#237;n a falta de abastecer cualquier necesidad y porque se transforman en cinco ocasiones en puntos de victoria, cuatro durante la misma, y una &#250;ltima al contabilizarlos de nuevo y dividirlos entre diez para dar ese n&#250;mero de puntos de nuevo.  Las sensaciones del juego son maravillosas: es evolucionar, es adaptar es crecer en lo militar, es putear con guerra, adelantarte a las necesiadades de los contrincantes, consolidadar la estabilidad, rezar para que las nuevas cartas favorezcan a tus necesidades, cruzar los dedos para que el nuevo evento no te destroce, correr contra los dem&#225;s por no ser el &#250;ltimo en la guerra, o ser el primero en estabilidad o.... y de mientras construir todas aquellas maravillas que ning&#250;n juego te ha permitido hacer, luchar con los ej&#233;rcitos m&#225;s poderosos y olvidados ludicamente, ser liderados por personajes no mediaticos, librar batallas decisivas que ning&#250;n juego reconoce y superar eventos desde la peste negra a las invasiones &#225;ndalas,  sucesos que marcaron el devenir y que han sido olvidados  mientras tus obreros desestabilizan la civilizaci&#243;n, pidiendo tambi&#233;n m&#225;s comida pero generando m&#225;s recursos. Ya digo: una experiencia gloriosa  Pero con un defecto: es decir, el juego es un diez. para lo que yo le pido es perfecto.... pero casi. Y el casi viene por el fuerte componente de azar. Casi no existe, es imperceptible: pero est&#225; a radales, detr&#225;s de cada volteo de cartas: Querer ir a militar y se inviable por no poder adquirir la &#250;nica carta que da poder&#237;o militar; o necesitar piedra y ver solo un edificio de la era uno. ni colonias ni edades doradas.... Todo mitigable con batallas y edades de oro pero que a partidas de cuatro jugadores son tan excasas que apenas te permiten arrastrarte por el tablero pididndo una pedra. Un apu&#241;etera piedra...  M&#225;s cosas: aquel mito de que las guerras no eran decisivas, que el poder&#237;o militar estaba mitigado por la solidez de la estabilidad era tan solo eso: un mito.  En el juego se brilla de distintas maneras pero si quieres ganar, has de ir a poder&#237;o militar y por supuesto a libros (cultura). Provocar una guerra y hacer comerse el punto de p&#233;rdida m&#225;s alg&#250;n recurso no hace gracia. Responder al poder&#237;o gastando recursos en colocar trabajodres que respndan a la fuerza de la guerra es un desgaste que no siempre es asumible.   El juego est&#225; tan bien testeado que al final de la partida la victoria se decide por dos tres puntos... y es ah&#237; donde miras tus huecos de colonias, tus maravillas incacabadas o los quecos que ocupan puestos en edicifios industriales.  Si lo sabr&#233; yo!</comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="">The rules are vague in some issues. Have some errors, typos, even on the player board there's a typo, come on, this is not acceptable nowadays.  Lots of things not explained in the rule book (mostly how the cards work in certain situations) fortunately the designers have na excelent FAQ and errata posted here. Also there's some good players aid and guides. So, that should not be a detriment to buying the game, though the price might, for what you get this is a bit overpriced. The player boards are thin and they're not even cardboard.   Feels like it was meant to be a 2 to 4 player game, but they stretched it to 5 players. Things like "the most" becomes "the 2 most" and the same for least.  The art work is nothing special but is functional.  The game play is very good, very simple, you basically buy cards, from a central space. Those cards can be building, army, wonders, leaders... and then allocate workers to certain buildings and armies to build your resources and knowledge.  The solitaire variant works and is very simple to use. It's a good way to fine-tune your game skills.</comment>

Much deeper than Memoir at not much more complexity. Scoring here is the inverse of Memoir - this game shines as a stand alone, expansions do not add much more to the core game.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Australia">How much more fun can a wargame be? Genuine tactics, coupled with easy to learn mechanics, makes for a fun day out. Just that much better than Memoir 44.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Australia">Quick to set up, puts you immediately into tactician mode, takes enough out of your hands ensuring the best laid plans will often go astray (highly contemporary to the era), no stacking, no need for informational markers to clutter play...  The best solitaire war gaming experience I have ever had without adjusting a single rule or procedure. This game forces you to do the best with what you have, not necessarily where you want to do it and in the face of a reactionary defender. Extreme solitaire compatibility as a result.</comment>

    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">Now, this is a great game, but it isn't for everyone. For instance, advanced syphilitics may find they lack the motor control necessary to manipulate the game pieces, and the comatose may find it difficult to get into the feel of the game. I've also heard (but cannot confirm from firsthand experience) that zombies have difficulty focusing on the higher tactical  decisions in the games and may wander off in search of brains. But if your spinal column hasn't been devoured by spirochetes, you're conscious, and you're not one of the living dead, cursed to walk the streets in eternal torment as punishment for a life of sin, you'll probably enjoy this game. </comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Australia">Ask me again when I'm better at this...  Ok, have played it a few times now and...nice work! (I still suck at it though :P) Definitly one of the better CDG out there, but the length and the sometime unclear (even post-errata) rules probably prohibits it from become a number one for me (a spot reserved for Washington's War).</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Australia">I love the incredible tension from having not enough resources to reach your goals.  I've only played twice (badly, while learning) but I think this game is just fantastic.  It has encouraged me to now buy several other (simpler) CDG games.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Indonesia">Fun and thought provoking game of WW1 at a strategic level. Many say its not historically accurate though. The optional rules in the Players' Guide fixes a few things to make it more historical.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United Kingdom">I like this game a lot, but I have a quite a few rule reservations about it.  Basically, I feel that it's a very good game that could have been a genuine classic top 5 ever wargame were it not for a few bad rules - which is a great shame.  This could have been the Hannibal of the 90s.  Bear with me whilst I have a rant first!  Whilst it now seems clear to me that the rules are not as impenetrable as they first appear, I still consider them to be overblown, occasionally irritating and at times just plain unclear.  I think that it's the scores of exceptions that cause the problem.  To my mind, it would be better if exceptions were flagged up as numbered footnotes and then placed below a line at the bottom of each page.  That way, you could first read the rules without the exceptions - and thus get the basics and then read them with the exceptions.  This would make them much more user friendly.  As they are, the rules as a whole are hardish, but they APPEAR monstrous!  The basics of the game are easy, but there are so many add-ons that it really makes it tough to learn.  A detailed example: I have fallen foul of rule 9.5.2.5 (yes there are that many sub-sections!). I based a whole turn's play on using The Italian Card as Replacement Points.  Everything I did was with that in mind, and then I found out that since my opponent was at Total War, I could only play the card as an event.  There are so many fiddly rules like that that a beginner can't remember them all!  In the event, I could have played a 4/4 card, as I did hold one, but then I would have more or less had to discard the Italian 5/5, which is practically worthless for the Allies at some points in the game.  Why not let the Allied player play the card ONLY ONCE as a 5/5 non-event play, or else play it as a 3/4 ops at any time.  I understand the historical point about Italy needing to enter the war, but the Allies lose VPs if they don't enter Italy after a certain point anyway.  That's should be enough.  As it is, this rule is a real nuisance for the Allies and the CP have much better 5/5 cards (esp if they win the race to Total War) in any case.  I can see it would be bad to let the Allies play the card as ops repeatedly, but as things are the rule works strongly for the CP.  In any case, this is an example of a fiddly rule that unnecessarily leaves a sour taste for one player.   The rules for SR-ing to the NE Map maybe clear for those who know the game, but for those who don't they are a possible cause of confusion.  Why no mention anywhere about other Allies apart from the BR (inc Aus), making 13.2.1 very open to interpretation?  And I found the bit about the Canadians unclear, too, but don't get me started on that or I'll write another two paragraphs!  The rules on Retreat also allow a situation were a retreating (and probably badly mauled) enemy can move two spaces TOWARDS your lines in such a way that it can leave you being Out of Supply when it comes to his turn - which is plainly both historically ridiculous and leaving the game open to the most gamey of gamey moves.  In fact, Supply in general is rather over harsh in this game.  Folks who complain that this isn't an historical simulation are correct, but IT IS a game full of historical possibilities and I'd like to see that extended.  Two examples:  There is not enough chance for Naval actions to make a big impact on the game.  The present naval cards are a bit weedy, except for Blockade.  I'd give the cards the possibility for more VPs, and allow BOTH sides to have the chance to gain VPs in a Naval Victory by playing HSF/Grand Fleet. See my variant here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekforum.php3?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=82630  As is, I don't think that the present cards reflect how Jutland, in particular, could have turned the war, and that for me is a BIG historical minus.  It was Churchill who rightly said that Jellicoe was "the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon," yet the game shows not a hint of that.   That rule change for me seems de-rigueur, but, for die-hard naval-buffs, why not add a couple of cards?  For the CP, I think there could have been a "Battlecruisers Raid Scarborough" card.  A second British naval card (Battlecruiser Patrol) could combat that play.  Similarly, the tank cards look a bit weedy. If it wasn't for the cock-up of a reluctant and uninspired elderly British General of the old-infantry-school who wouldn't follow the tanks when they reached their objectives, the Battle of Cambrai could have swung the war dramatically - that it didn't wasn't due to tanks but to a old-fashioned cock-up.  Maybe something like these cards are in the extras that come with the Player's Guide. If not, I would consider adding them as extras.  This is a historical game, so why not add that truer flavour?  Anyway, despite my reservations, it's still a very good game and I'm sure that I will enjoy playing it many times in the future - especially on ACTS, where it's much easier to play than F2F.  The game is exciting and fun and a pretty good representation of WW1 (on land anyway). On the negative side it is hard to learn and the rules are at times inelegant and confusing.  You know, I'd probably edge this game towards a 10 were it not for those rule problems!  </comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">What could I say that hasn't been already said?  This is one of the greatest games ever made.  There is so much to do with so few cards to do them with.  You have so many possibilities with the cards.  It captures all of what makes card driven games great. If you have never played this game or any of its off-spring (Shifting Sands/WWII: Barbarossa to Berlin/Pursuit of Glory), be careful: the system is not intuitive.  Be sure to play with an experienced player either face-to-face or VASSAL, because it's really easy to screw things up.  But don't let this warning scare you.  This game is well worth the time to learn it.</comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="France">Paths of Glory est vraiment un excellent jeu. Equilibr&#233; et palpitant jusqu'au bout. La fameuse r&#232;gle qui paralyse compl&#232;tement les arm&#233;es encercl&#233;es est dure, mais parfaitement justifi&#233;e pour reconstituer les strat&#233;gies de l'&#233;poque. Le probl&#232;me &#233;tant quand m&#234;me que dans la plupart des cas, m&#234;me un joueur exp&#233;riment&#233; finit toujours par faire une petite erreur qui causera un encerclement et par l&#224; m&#234;me sa perte. Voir la r&#233;volution russe ou l'arriv&#233;e des Am&#233;ricains reste rare dans une partie de Paths of Glory. L'autre grande question est de savoir si ce jeu est une bonne simulation du conflit. Mais l&#224;, je n'ai pas encore le recul n&#233;cessaire pour r&#233;pondre...  Automatic english translation:  Paths off Glory is really an excellent play. Balance and palpitating until the end. The famous rule which completely paralyses the encircled armies hard, but is justified perfectly to reconstitute the strategies of the time. The problem being nevertheless that in the majority of the cases, even an experienced player always ends up making a small error which will cause a surrounding and consequently its loss. See the Russian revolution or the arrival of the Americans remains rare off in part of Paths Glory. The other great question is to know if this play is a good simulation of the conflict. But there, I do not have yet the retreat necessary to answer&#8230;   ;-)</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Brazil">The best card driven wargame, in my opinion, when compared to the others that I know (Twilight Struggle, Washington's War, For the People, Barbarossa to Berlin, Empire of the Sun, Hannibal, Wilderness War and a few others). Rivals with For the People for the first spot.  Very immersive and tense. Extremely tough decisions when deciding which front deserves the scarce resources that come with each card played.  My only complaints are:  1) the intrincate rules about what countries can and cannot do in the middle east. I'm not sure it adds that much to a design that was already fantastic, but gives the perception to some of my friends that the whole game is complicated, when in reality it's not. But, to me, these mid east exceptions and fiddleness are nothing that a good player aid cannot solve. I just wish I didn't need it.  2) the harsh supply rules. In our group, we play with Barbarossa's rule, where you check supply after YOU play your last card and not after THE LAST PLAYER plays his last card. It makes a whole lot of difference, making the game much less "gamey", without screwing up the balance. Great design. A shame that it doesn't hit the table more often.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="New Zealand">Card driven war games are definitely my favourites in my limited experience in historical simulation games. This one is no exception. Need to play more.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="United States">Unbeatable chesslike gameplay.  Bit of a brain burner but the choices are at least finite.  So far...</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Australia">The game lives up to the hype. Great overview of WW1 with lots of manuever in the East and Middle East and Gridlock in the West. Has a 3 turn tourney variant which is also a good taster for the full game. VASSAL module + Skype.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Canada">Solid, tense and well balanced. The handling of the cards is arguably better here than in any other game I've played. Nearly every decision requires careful thought and it is painful to give up alternatives. Initiative is key, one wants his opponent to be in the position of reacting as much as possible and the tension between playing for ops, events or rp's makes hand management and tough choices the name of the game. Its weaknesses (as stated below) are relatively minor considering how good this game can be.  Suffers from front fixation where players get drawn into spending all their cards activating forces on one front while ignoring other fronts for long periods of time. Can be somewhat gamey.</comment>

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Norway">Love this game, have had several plays of Railroad Tycoon in addition, which is essentially the same game.  Really gives you the feeling of building a successful economic engine, and is not too unforgiving (as is my understanding of how AoS plays, without having ever played). Simple mechanic, but deep game play. Random setup gives a fresh feeling for every game.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Norway">My absolute favourite game, regardless of genre. Lots of interesting choices to make and every game so far has been really intense. Love how the game require both tactical sense and card management. Also, the various random events helps make every session unique. When playing, one can't plan every little detail but have to "think on one's feet" as the game progresses, which I like a lot. I'm no wargamer, but this game makes me want to become one.   EDIT: Three years later I still consider this a great game, but after playing lots of different wargames my preferences have changed a bit.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United Kingdom">My first real war game but this is excellent. Feels like there's a huge amount of replayability with all the maps, countries and setup options. While there is luck involved it still feels like you have control over your actions and skill will prevail.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Based on a few solo plays and one mutant hybrid four-player multiplayer game. A rip-roaring good time -- even for a three-hour game, it moved very fast. I can see that strategies will reveal themselves through repeated plays as one becomes more familiar with the various armies. I would play every weekend given the time and opportunity.  UPDATE: Upped from my original rating of 8. After a few more conventional two-player plays using the rules as-written (thanks to my eternally obliging son), the chaos and fluidity of the game really shine through. Choices and opportunities shift from round to round, forcing you to plan on the fly. I can't seem to win to save my life, but that doesn't diminish my enjoyment of the game one iota. Fantastic stuff, endlessly engaging and variable. A truly great game.  ALSO WITH: Battle Packs 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Very promising after one play. A bit concerned about randomness being too great, but the cinematic experience is there.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">The cards give the game a fog of war quality I enjoy. The scenario generator is a big plus. It's the best game to have if you &amp; one other gamer are stuck on a desert island.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">My first time playing was a blast.  A great competitive game that trades full tactical control for giving you a feel for the fog and friction of combat.  Beautiful presentation and simple rules with a realistic flavor for the challenges of squad level combat without the tedium of more accurate systems like ASL.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Canada">Very very very close to a ten. That last half a point is for the occasional game where it feels like you were completely boned by random chance. Doesn't happen often, but it does happen.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">Clever techniques to avoid player downtime and encourage interaction. Very limited random elements is a drawback but deliberate, themey action options keep it from feeling like a victory point salad. Great game for people normally plagued with AP, as each decision is essentially limited to only two options. Starting initial conditions are varied just the right amount. Recommended by lowplayercount.com. </comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United Kingdom">Having only played Kanban before this (in terms of Vital's designs) I am starting to get a feel for his designer fingerprints. Very intricate Euros; apparently simple decision trees with blossoming webs of possibilities leading off of them. The theme comes through well enough though not as strongly as in Kanban, but the decisions are indeed wonderful. Everything clicked halfway through and I'm really keen to give this another go and re-evaluate.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Malaysia">If there is one boardgame to describe myself, it would be The Gallerist! Boardgames with personal player board (and a beautiful one I must add) always excites me and The Gallerist is no exception. Everything you do in the game is full with theme. You can only commissioned one artist at a time and you can buy their work of art at the initial fame cost. An artist can only have at most 2 work of art on display because of their inspiration limitation (haha). As you buy their work of art, more visitors will come to the plaza &amp; the artist fame will increase as well, and it also depends on how many collectors in your gallery &amp; how much influence (per fame icon) you want to use to increase his fame. You can promote the artist using influence (per fame icon) at the media center. Once you have matching contract, sell the work of art &amp; the buyer (1 of the visitor in your gallery) will go back to plaza. The more you sell works of art, the more collectors will flock your gallery! When you have visitors in the lobby, you can send your assistants to the international market to build reputation or bid for renowned work of art and gain you more money at the end of the game the more assistants you have there. It's all very thematic &amp; full with satisfaction! There's one time during the game where I was almost out of options, I don't have anymore money thus I cannot do auction or hire new assistants, I don't have anymore assistant to build reputation at international market, I have 3 unfulfilled contracts, I have 3 work of arts in my gallery but none match the contracts thus I cannot sell them and none of the artists is a celebrity so I cannot use the masterpiece slot for any of my existing work of art before buying a new one and I can't discover any artist because I still have one commissioned artist under me. Luckily after calculating all the available options, I have enough influence (per fame icon) to promote an artist, thus opening up new options for me. Stuff like this really makes The Gallerist shining through with its richness in theme. During the final rounds of the game, I promote 1 of the artist I discovered to celebrity status because I have his work of art, forgotten that my sister also has his work of art at her gallery, which gave her extra money as well. A mistake that shows how connected the gameplay and theme is. Although this was our first play, especially for my sister, since I did read the rules &amp; watched some videos prior to playing the game, our scores were not that far apart from each other 161 to 139! Sign of a good and balanced game, unlike FCM. Our first play concluded in about an hour plus and we did some mistakes like putting the starting reputation tile at the wrong place (not the 3rd slot of our gallery), using each influence to increase artist fame instead of per fame icon, wrong interpretation of collectors rule, assistant may come from the office or other location but not from contract bonus which can only be used once and probably we didn't send the visitor from our gallery/lobby to the plaza one or two time after selling work of art/take reputation tile, and also forgot to increase influence at the international market, but overall, it's a great learning game! The downside of the game is that the kicked-out actions &amp; executive actions make the game longer, more complex &amp; complicated than it already is. Probably after some playtesting, the designer decided to make the action to move visitors &amp; use contract bonus as exec actions. The kicked-out action is quite innovative but it does make the gameplay a bit messy &amp; befuddling. I also learned that the symbol of both VIP &amp; collector increasing influence is called a "party" and the symbol of both investor &amp; collector increasing money is called a "meeting". The brown investor is related to money, the pink VIP is related to influence &amp; the white collector is related to fame. Nice little details! Discover artists, buy works of art, promote artists, sign contracts, sell works of art, hire &amp; send assistants to international market whether to build reputation or bid for renowned work of art. it's all in a day's job of The Gallerist! This is a boardgame to be played in a sophisticated approach &amp; environment. One of my personal favourite alongside Terra Mystica! Absolutely the perfect birthday present for myself!</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Canada">This would be a 10 if it wasn't so heavy on the rules - not that it's hard to learn, there's just a volume of rules to remember. Teaching new players is an ordeal. Otherwise it's such a beautiful and balanced game and we adore playing it.</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">Based on first play.  Awesome worker placement game.  Very simple playing mechanics but very difficult decisions to make.  The core actions of the game are not hard to learn.  It's all the engine building and varying means of accumulating points that's challenging.  It'll take a few plays to come up the learning curve.  This one has the potential to break into my personal top 5 games.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Canada">Vital!!  The crunchiest game I have.  Love the interaction.  Very thematic game with the best production you will likely see in board gaming.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Greece">Lacerda's best game so far. Very thematic mechanics and there is a learning curve. After a 3rd play I still find it difficult to deduce if I benefit from the actions I am taking.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United Kingdom">Stellar game. I've played it a few times now but still haven't worked out solid routes to doing well in the game. It's also one of those games that you'll play and then spend the evening thinking about. Really really impressed.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="">long setup.  quite heavy, but not in danger of AP because of the few actions available. a "whose turn is it" - token is recommended.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="">The best game from Vital until now.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">So, no offense to Vital, but Food Chain Magnate took up a good deal of my game-space this year. It just seems unreasonable that he keeps getting better. Keep waiting for Vitals designs to feel samey. I am still waiting.  Big, heavy, unforgiving....love it.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">So chunky and so elegant, yet gets a "way too heavy" stigma on BGG for some reason.  I would weight it at 3.75 tops, and feel that Dungeon Petz and Alchemists is heavier... or maybe just harder to teach.  I think that learning the sub-steps of the 8 action selections is key, and one play-through is almost required to see how everything flows... but so sweet once you get it.  Climbing the charts as one of my favorites.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">A modern classic.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">This was, for a time, my least favorite owned Vital game (behind Vinhos and Kanban).  However, it has been edging up ever since.  It is probably the least immediately intuitive (I think likely due to the theme) but repeat plays really, really opens this up.  I love it now.  Update: This can drag at 4-player and overstay its welcome.  Everyone has to know the game and be snappy players or the downtime and overall length gets a bit excessive for a game that doesn't have a feeling of escalation.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Belgium">My second 10 on BGG. Great game!</comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Canada">Fantastic, heavy Euro. Superb components and integration of theme throughout the many aspects of this game. Could easily feel like a disjointed point salad, but the integrated design and theme tie everything together into a package that doesn't dissolve under the weight of its myriad of combos and options. On top of this, downtime was minimal although we played with four players.   We didn't finish our first play, one of our group had to leave. But we likely would have been done inside 45 minutes thus giving a first 4-player play, where only one of us had played once before, done in under 3 hours. The amount of meaty "gameplay" that we got in that chunk of time was phenomenal. Can't wait to play again.  Update 06/25/16: Second play, bumped from 8.5 to 9. This game is awesome.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">A wonderful game: beautiful components, challenging, tense gameplay, and a heavy but not too heavy rule set. Along with CO2, this is probably my favorite Lacerda game (and I could see this surpassing CO2 with future plays).  My favorite aspect of the game lies in all of the bonus actions: almost everything you do opens opportunities for other things to do. Hire an artist, and take a ticket. Go to the international market, make some money. Assign an assistant, boost your reputation. Each action can be chained to other actions to create awesome combos usually seen only in card games. Many decisions you make over the course of the game, then, are incredibly rewarding. Scoring is tight, and just uncertain enough that it's tense right up until the end.   Probably my favorite game from 2015.</comment>

    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="Norway">Rated after three repeated plays. I usually never feel that I have to replay a game when I finish one session, but this was amazing. First play you get to know the roles, second play you tried a strategy that failed miserably, but it would have worked if only... So you have to play just one more time, but this time you try another God with different strategy, and someone else is doing something you never would have though of with your former God... It just goes on.   I like the mix of euro worker-placement and ameritrash dice-slaughter. Its both and neither.  Maybe it will grow old in the end, but this game also feels very balanced. If I do not discover a radical strategy that ruins this balance, I look forward to many sessions of CitOW.  Note: I knew nothing of the Warhammer universe before buying the game, two of the people in my group did. I did not feel it was an issue for me, the game stand very well on its own.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="United States">Strange and enjoyable area control game with a twisted sense of humor.</comment>
    <comment game="Chaos in the Old World" game_id="43111" location="">Just a generally cool game. Great asymmetry, lots of stuff going on, multiple approaches to victory, solid interaction. Has some problems with worthless options and unequal player skills, but I still adore it.</comment>

It is very easy to learn and a good game to play while carrying on a conversation. The game has beautiful artwork and is well built. The cards are bigger on this version (bigger than the USA version), which I really like. The kids enjoy it too so it is a great family game. I highly recommend it!</comment>

This made it very odd, as there was no conflict between players whatsoever.  Better luck for the next game.  Oh, it was a draw!  She could beat me at this, seems like she's a natural.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="Finland">Super fun, and much bettter than the original! Even fun for two players. It looks nice, it works nice and smooth and there is much more room for tactics than in the America-version!</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United States">The best of the Ticket to Ride games...so far. The use of stations, ferries and tunnels adds more details without adding complexity. A great variation on the original.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United Kingdom">How to make a great game better?  Well, maybe.  I thought so at first, but now maybe not.  Having said that, anyone who likes TtR is almost bound to love this.  Here's some pointers as to what's good about this: the set up of the cities and the routes between them creates a different challenge (there are less double routes and more short routes); it's fun to see that one side of the board (the West) is very congested and the other is quite sparse and tends towards longer routes; there are many obvious blocking ponts...but; the new mechanism of stations helps to unblock those and I love the fact that if you chose to play one you effectively lose points at the end; the ferries add another interesting touch and thinking point; the tunnels are a (realistic) stroke of genius - there could have been lots of possibilites for how to model this but the way it's been done strikes me as perfect - after all digging tunnels could be a gamble - would you hit harder or weaker rock?; the length 8 route worth 21 points is great fun; the designer has made it more useful to pick up Locos (you need them!) and and to draw extra destination tickets; everyone gets one long route at the start (but doesn't have to use it) and that strikes me as a good leveller.  A smashing game that is significantly different from the original and more of a "gamer's-game."  I suppose some will try to adopt different rules from the two versions together.  I'm happy, for now, to have this, the original and the unofficial Belgian variant. I do, however, look forward to a future Mystery train Expansion for this.  And I'm excited enough to put forward some ideas  - Tunnelling Mole (burrow at normal cost), Ferry Owner - travel over ferries without locos, Station Master - play one station without losing points at the end.  The possibilities are exciting!</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Finland">2009-09-10 Better than Age of Steam (which is not a bad game either...) for the following reasons: 1) Adapts to less experienced players as well 2) Looks nicer  2015-11-04 To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years.   With Steam I guess the reason was that, unless you played regularly, you need to reread the rules everytime you play. This in turn, decreases the chances of Steam finding its way onto the table. This is essentially the same problem I was experiencing with Brass, which is another Wallace game btw. If I only had more space to store my games...</comment>

Se juega mejor que su predecesor, Age of Steam, y tiene componentes buenos y &#250;tiles (y aunque no trae los trenecitos de pl&#225;stico de otros juegos eso no influye!). Adem&#225;s el juego viene con dos mapas y dos modos de juego, el b&#225;sico y el estandard. -------------------------------------------------- Best of Wallace's, and one of the best management or economic games you can play. Economic and train simulation with lots of hard choices to make: building up your railroad, delivering goods, developing cities and towns, issuing shares and paying back your creditors... It has better gameplay than its predeccessor, Age of Steam, with nice and useful components (though it doesn't have those nice little plastic trains, this doesn't affect the gameplay). Also the game comes with two maps and two game modes, one basic and the other the standard one.</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Canada">First impressions is that this game has the depth and tough decisions I like in a game.  It's more puzzle than I had thought with maximizing cube transport.  </comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Germany">Otro gran juego de Wallace, lo &#250;nico, que es dif&#237;cil de pillar en una primer a partida.</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="England">What seems a relatively simple train game soon becomes a real brain burner as the options are taken away from you by your rivals. Definately do not play with the analysis paralysis gamer, as you could soon lose the will to live by the time they move. With the right group though a splendid way to spend a couple of hours. </comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="New Zealand">[MWTRTG].  This is the best incarnation of this series. Better than Age of Steam, better than RRT.  The base game makes for a very nice streamlined version - money isn't so brutally tight, but positioning and timing are still just as important.  And the standard game's good too though I think I prefer base now.  Excellent game!</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Australia">after one play i have to say i think this game works really well.  i have trouble with the bland art work that would have been great in 1985.. but it's way to insipid for the naughties.. too many hard to read images.. too PC processed... get an artist to work on this..  the dude who did Powergrid would be awesome for this.  But the game is great!!</comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United States">A fun and streamlined railroad game.  Features some really intuitive mechanics which aids new players in focusing more about game decisions and less on rules.  The components all work well, and while the ownership markers may be more boring compared to Age of Steam or Railways of the world, the track tiles seem to be of much better quality and of greater variety.  Other aspects I appreciate in steam is the improved Goods cube allocation, in that City Growth actions and Urbanization can be better planned for.  Overall the well designed components and streamlined nature of Steam make it both a very fun and Strategic experience.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Italy">Elegant and simple mechanics, probably one of the best implementation of an auction system, great variety of options and paths to victory, fast to play and easy to learn. It's good with any number of players, you learn its main dynamics just after the first turn and then it's all a matter of choices, trying to balance your long term strategy to the opportunities that every turn presents. You have to maximize the effectiveness of every action you have at your disposal, while managing your resources in order to gain victory points and more actions. The system is simple enough to give you always the right perspective on your situation and let you concentrate on your options, to the point that, at the end of the game, you can easily spot the errors in your strategy, what went wrong and how it did. There&#8217;s not much direct interaction among the players and theme is not exactly dripping from the mechanics, but it&#8217;s one of those rare cases in which I don&#8217;t mind.  Great (as usual) Hans im Gl&#252;ck quality: good components, well designed and functional. You could use a playing aid about exploration cards and tile use, but a couple of plays is all you need to learn the meaning of every symbol.  P.S. remember to use the right rule about the exploration path: first discard the cards that would be in excess and then draw the new ones. </comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Spain">Superb game. Only played with 2. Filled with tense decisions and alternative strategies with an excellent balance between managing your own position and countering your opponents. Would be a 10 if it weren't for the suspicion that it's so well-balanced that almost anything you do might lead you to victory or defeat and it's not possible to tell what actions leading where but hopefully more plays will sort that </comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">Just started playing this again.  Love it but got to learn not to buy my own auction goods every turn, so I run out of money too often.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Greece">I love this game. Published back in 2004 and still remains one of the best games I've ever played. I never say no to a game of Goa.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Netherlands">One of my favorites.  You could wake me up to play Goa.  The agonizing choices and the 'ooohhh, if I could do just one more thing' feeling makes up for a very tense game. </comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">Rudiger Dorn at his finest.  An outstanding game!  The auctions work well and everything maintains a solid balance, so nobody is really out of it.  Must play with the expedition card balance fix though.</comment>

    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">My son was not interested in Goa, which is rare for him not to want to play a new game, but we made a deal with him that if he won, he could stay up two hours past bedtime. Needless to say, he was very attentive to the explanation of game play and did a great job, even took the "A" round hands down. He ended up loving it, but came in third. (We still let him stay up a little later.) I asked him what he would rate this and he said a "9". I could not agree more. Love, love, love Goa.  </comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">Up, up, up go my ratings for this very meaty game with a ton of options.  It has a bit of a learning curve to play well.  My first game opinion and rating - "ok, but confusing - 5", after 2 games - "kind of fun, but can't figure out how to win - 7", after 3 games - "this is a good game - 8", after 4 games - "I love this game! - 9"  Not an easy game for a newcomers to grasp and I would definitely place it in the "gamers game" category. </comment>

    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Spain">Mostly played as two-player game. During my first plays I found it too derivative and with some forced mechanisms. But I learnt to like it. I look forward to my next game.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Canada">One of my best game ! </comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="">If only we could play more often!  It's a great game, but it is always [i]stressful[/i] -- every move counts.  So it doesn't work as an evening's fun, and leaves you thinking long after the game is over.  The tiles (yes the tiles, not the expedition cards) serve the purpose of cards in Agricola, varying the game with each play -- but Dorn's done it better, in that in Agricola most cards are fairly weak, while in Goa the tiles can be critical -- but you get to bid on them, which makes it less luck-dependent.  True, the expedition cards can introduce random luck, when both players play well, but a little luck isn't bad.  Not every game must be Caylus.  What's more, as our plays increase, it becomes less stressful, and the rules are surprisingly easy to remember even if you go a month or two without playing.  It's just a great game!</comment>

    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Hong Kong">It's a solid auction game with lots of different choices of actions available. I notice that there are lots of interactions during the auction phase, but everyone then works on their own board individually. That's the reason for a 9 but not 10. Yet, it's still a great game with very high replayability. Highly recommanded!</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Austria">Respect, viticulture (incl. Tuscany) is a wonderful charming game.... I love also the artwork very much...</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">It's a medium-light Euro with a surprising amount of depth. While it may seem like there's one path to victory (fulfilling orders), that's not actually the case. There are various avenues to score victory points and it is best to diversify so you aren't hindered by lack of worker placement spots. Very good game and I want to play more.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Philippines">Fun worker-placement game about making and selling wine. Turns go fast, decisions are interesting, and there is a lot of things in the base game. The expansion makes it even better.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Australia">Intending to purchase this as part of the Tuscany kickstarter in March 2014.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">Have only played this with the Tuscany expansion. Interesting game but having read the rules for the base game alone, don't feel like I'd enjoy the game as much without the expansion as it really changes the game. With the expansion, it's highly enjoyable.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">Beautiful worker placement game that is thematic, scales well and is equal parts approachable and challenging.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="South Africa">I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Some really cool stuff going on here, and a compelling theme. I like process driven games like Le Havre, so this worked well for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Hungary">Very good worker placement. Super theme. Intuitive mechanics.  Bit too long with 6p. I think it's best with 2 or 4.  D&#243;ri: First I thought that I won't like this game as I do not really like games where I have to manage the resources. But in this game the game mechanism, the rules, the little accessories are built up in a very-very logival and self-understood that you don't mind the many small rules. The cards, the board, the money and everything in the game is very well-designed and beautiful. For two-players it is relatively fast (~40 minutes), but with more players (above 4) it is very-very long. I really like that I can follow a lot of different strategies in the games not to mention that the expansion makes changes in the game where it was needed (e.g. in the beginning we have little money, that's why Mamas and Papas come and we can inherit some money/worker/etc. from them). 8/10</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Belgium">good integration of the theme in a boardgame. Plays fluent.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Switzerland">Viticulture is a rock-solid game in the vain of Kennerspiel des Jahres. It offers great variety and multiple approaches as winning-paths.  Its biggest strength lies in the setting &#8211; making wine is a theme that has yet to see frowning faces (unlike Fantasy, Sci-Fi or agriculture). The action-spaces available all make perfectly sense even if they are abstracted a bit. This really helps to introduce the game and hook players.  Among your workers you have a special "grande" worker who can go to action-spaces that are already occupied. This reduces the amount of blocking in the game, which gives newer players some leeway, but still offers interesting decisions when to use him as a game-round is broken into multiple phases.  With the addition of the superb expansion [thing=147101]Tuscany[/thing] the game gets additional 15 modules that you can mix and match to perfectly adjust the game's complexity to your needs.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">Love trying new strategies out with this game.  FYI, the playtime always winds up much longer than I anticipate. Also, I'll never play without Tuscany again.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="Canada">I really like the theme. It was well implemented that I could feel the romance of running a winery. Gameplay-wise I would say its a light-medium weighted worker placement game due to the fact that the cards you draw play an important role. Some helper cards are really powerful and some are rather weak. So expect some luck involved in the game. However you still need some good planning to do well</comment>

    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="Canada">Just finished playing the "Tutorial" and first mission. Highly polished game, great production value. Finishing up the mission made us wish we had time for a second go!</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">Only played through the first game so far, but the polish is nice and the gameplay quick despite it being a programmer....might slow down if I try to win instead though. </comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United Kingdom">Outstanding quality game. Lots of fun to play - only played 1st mission but there seems to be plenty in the box. Review to be reconsidered when all missions are played. Will we need more missions afterwards? Who knows.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">This game is a great combination of programming and cooperation. With 10 missions that all feel different, the gameplay doesn't get old. Incredible components, clear rules, and something my kid loves makes this a keeper!</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="">LIKE:  - stunning production and charming components - very fun cooperative experience - the programming mechanic offers a unique and interesting experience - unlocking new stuff with each mission - multi-use Command cards - light enough to easily teach, but plenty of challenge (especially with 2 players)  DISLIKE:  - can be a bit of a chore to set up and pack away - box is huge (not necessarily a negative thing, but it'll require a lot of shelf space) - a few misprints and some ambiguities in the rules</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United Kingdom">Brilliant fun. Amazing production quality.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="Canada">3 games played. Very good game so far. Can't wait to play more.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="Germany">Still have only completed up to Mission 3 (inclusive) so it might still move up. But so far, I have replayed the beginning missions a couple of times each and enjoyed each play. So should be good for multiple plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">Amazing game with amazing quality components. It should cost a lot more than the $75 price tag. Pre-painted minis and mechs. Heavy stock cardboard. High quality player cards. It can be infinitely expandable if only they'd release some expansionsl lol! You can play this game for years.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">Wow. Just wow. Completely overproduced co-op programming game. I thought there might not be much of a game under all of that chrome, bit I was incorrect. Brett and I played through the tutorial and the first 2 missions. It was so much fun. Learning the programming correctly to do what you want to accomplish can really be difficult, but it is possible. Riot knocked it out of the park with this winner. We will get the rest of those envelopes opened and played soon! </comment>

    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">If you told me that a video game designer was going to make a board game, i'd assume it to be mediocre at best. If you told me the components would be out of this world, i'd guess the gameplay was only okay, and that the cost would be well over $100.   The TL;DR version is that this is a ridiculously well produced, fairly straight forward, incredibly fun game, that costs $75 with shipping. This was accomplished by only being sold by the publisher and not distributed to any retailers. Mechs vs minions is a cooperative program building scenario based game with beautiful minis and art, and a game system that is clever and unique enough that it has reviewers going "I don't normally like programming/coop/dudes on board/etc. but with this game it's great" This game is currently my 2nd favorite of all time, and my wife's favorite of all time. This is not just for the components, but the gameplay is incredibly solid and fun. Most games are close whether won or lost, and the various scenarios are all entertaining in their own right and I would gladly play any of them again. Also this is about 1 hour of play when you know how to play.  You may have to wait a bit for the next shipment but this game is worth it.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">My first real taste of the programming mechanic and boy do I dig it!!  This game is a total hit and, as you well know, the components are awesome!</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United Kingdom">I'm conflicted whether to give this one a 9 or a 10. It's very very good. Best game to play with kids over 10yrs old, for sure. In the end, I've docked a point due to some rules errors/ambiguities which detracted slightly.   We're half way through the campaign and its been great fun. The game makes me want to giggle. The production quality is amazing from the huge box, lovely artwork, THICK cardboard, lovely miniatures to the cute "radioplay" soundtracks available online setting the scene.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">Probably rated so high due to the cult of the new. We've done the tutorial and the first mission and it was really fun. The production quality is insanely good and the gameplay is simple and fun. I'm really excited to see how the future missions go.</comment>

The tutorial is a little bit boring at first, but when you're a few minutes into mission 1 it starts getting really interesting.  The only thing that is not that great are the rules. How they are explained is pretty cool, but they often leave you with some questions. These great components, together with a really great Gameplay is just ridiculous for 75 dollars.  Go get it while you still can!</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">A great game.  Obviously the component quality ups the fun factor, but this is a really good game aside from that.  Solid mechanics and really fun.</comment>

    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">I really enjoy this game, and it hits most of my hot buttons in a board game: loads of player interaction, zero downtime, endless variety. The only problem is that it doesn't work as a 2 player game, and really best when it's 5 (or more, if you have the expansions), so that limits how often this hits the table.  UPDATED 6-16-14: Bumped to a 10, and I'm not sure why it took me this long to do so. There is nothing I dislike about this game, I always am up to play it, and there are few in our gaming group who aren't just as excited to play this anytime we get a chance.   UPDATED 7-13-16: Dropped to a 9. I still love it, but I can just never get it to the table anymore. Is it still a 10 if no one will play it with you?</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United Kingdom">Was pleased to find I really enjoy this Marmite game. Not in my usual ballpark but my ears always perk up when I hear a game of this being arranged. Solid hand management at its core and the vast array of alien powers will keep games feeling eternally fresh.</comment>

Our eight year-old here recently went on an eight-game undefeated streak... in spite of everyone's best intentions to "bring him down." He still won. ;)  Stuff like that makes any game an instant win for me.  UPDATE: This game gets better every time I play it, regardless of the outcome. CC is simply "awesome" in a box.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">You can't have a conversation about the best games ever made without including Cosmic Encounter in the conversation.

    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">good fun.  interesting powers.  I like that the rules are relatively basic, but all the powers break the rules, so it becomes more a game to out play / negotiate the other players.   I thought about it some more on why this is a much better game than say something like munchkin or any get to x amount of points, scramble to the top style game.   Although the main core game is the same, the alien power interaction makes each game unique.  There's some potential for a dud experience but generally the way the different combination play out will blow your mind.  Where as the other games tend to always be the same.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="Latvia">It's just a lot of fun! :)</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="Singapore">A good game that is amazing in the fact that the balance between the luck aspect of the draw and the strategy seems really tight. That being said the different race's powers and the subsequent player interactions due to it is where the game is at and they seem balanced. They create such unique conversations and even ones where you might want to lose to win or just say that to betray someone.  Downside is the lucky draw of encounter and destiny cards can win someone the game (A more rare situation than you might think, as everyone can be involved in fights) and if all are playing the game straight up without lying, it will not live up to its potential of fun. That being said overall, I can't think of a game that is similar to a collection like Cosmic Encounter. I would def. seek out a copy if it were not for the fact everyone I play with has a copy with expansions.  </comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="South Korea">OH WOW!  I've played it only once, so I cannot yet say I will always want to play it.  However, between the base game and everything people have added to it, I know I have only just scratched the surface (any more variety, and I'd say this game crosses the line to becoming a game system).  I have not had this much fun interacting with other game players in a very long time, and I am confident it can only get better.  This sets the bar for all other variable strength games in my book.  I recommend you read the reviews of more experienced players for all the reasons this is such a good game.  The FF bits, BTW, are a hair's breath from perfection.</comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - an epic space battle game based on the Warhammer universe. You control one of four space races tyring to collect the number of flags necessary (depending on the number of players) to win. It is very action packed, as there is almost no time to build up a stronghold. You have to explore and conquer, and sometimes let go of previously owned bases. The combat system is very good, as at the end not the remaining number of unit counts, but their morale. So it is possible to win a combat by having only one unit with a bigger morale value, rather than many units with lower values. The planning phase is borrowed from the Starcraft boardgame: stacking the actions, an whoever has the top action goes first.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Great tactical battling game with more strategy than most. Feels a bit like Kemet meets Eclipse. Rules are very well written and made the first play relatively straightforward.   The comment about the sculpts is ridiculous. They are some of the best board game sculpts out there, and the game never felt crowded, IMO.   This is a perfect 2-3 player game; 4 might be a bit too long for people who aren't into longer games, but I'd give a 4P game a shot.   Highly recommended for those who are into a deeper tactical combat game. </comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Love love love. I love the units (cool minis!) and the order stacking mechanic. The card + dice combat is super interesting and unique. Great fantastic game.</comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Germany">Awesome game. There nothing to complain. Went after the first play straight into my Top 10.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Australia">Pro's:  1) Massive fan of the warhammer universe, so the theme pretty much speaks to me directly which makes be biased towards liking the game. 2) The aesthetics of the game are fantastic: The miniatures, the board tiles themselves, the little plastic city, factory and bastion pieces. Seeing your empire taking up sectors of space makes you feel warm and fuzzy. 3) The combat system and the deck upgrade system feels great when you pull it off. This is probably my favourite combat system I have thus far encountered in any game despite the length it can take to play. 4) Each faction feels unique and through the cards and miniatures captures the style of playing them pretty damn well. 5) Epic scale is as Warhammer 40K should be.  Con's:  1) The game is long, and certainly playing a 4 player game pretty much requires a full afternoon. 2) I really hope to see some more factions come out. Tau, Tyranids and Necrons even though this now seems unlikely because of licensing (edit: definitely not happening now). 3) I wish the ultramarines were replaced with a more generic Imperium faction, with some reference to the imperial guard, the adeptus mechanicus, the administratum, ecclesiarchy and the rest of the poorly run bureaucratic elements within the imperium of man.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="">Awesome game! From placing/resolving the orders, over deck building, to the intense fighting. 9/10, since you have to endure the fights between your friends without much to do (other than pray for them not to fall into AP).</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Initial Impressions: ---------------------- This IS the most epic space game to come out since TI:3.  I really like the order token mechanism in this one, which they just stole from Starcraft.  I also actually really enjoy the combat, although I can image if you are not involved in the combat, it could be boring to follow along (only played 2p so far).  I think once I get this played with more players I will actually enjoy it more, however this will end up being like War of the ring &amp; Game Of Thrones, where they are big epic games that I really enjoy, but I only get to play this once a year.  This one is a keeper, and I actually am really excited to see where they take this game with expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Poland">The game is very enjoyable. The only major drawback is long play time (can easily hit 5h in 4-player game!)</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="">2016  Love the components, 40k theme, focus on aggressiveness, and civ-building built into the tech tree for order and components.  Gameplay can drag, and rules seem too nuanced at times.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Oh my, Forbidden Stars.  If I have 2 to 4 hours and a couple of very committed friends, this is probably my first choice of board game to play.  So good.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Germany">sleeved  That is one hell of a game. Although I sold my Warhammer 40k army I'm still a big fan of the lore and the universe.  The combat system is what drew me to that game and after I played it there is much more that makes me want it. The order tokens are a pretty cool sytem with the stack building. Really really cool.</comment>

    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="Canada">*Another* Rosenberg masterpiece, solidifying his spot as my favorite designer. A Feast For Odin truly feels like a 'sandbox' game, with not only multiple paths to victory, but truly a wide-open array of options which can work well together. That is, it's not "you either go path a or path b", it's that you can pick and choose from a juicy array of choices each turn, and still pull off satisfying combinations that give an advantage. My one knock against Odin is that it doesn't have the engine building mechanic that Caverna, Le Havre, or Agricola have- but it makes up for it with an absolute deluge of strategic choices that still are manageable, and most of all, fun.</comment>
    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="">Aaaaamazing. I had to clear a shelf for it because it's huge but what an incredible piece of work. There's a lot of depth here, huge design space, can render people AP, but I've never felt a reason to minmax when I've played. It's deep but not hard, which is a hallmark of Uwe's designs.

It's long, but so far the kids enjoy it enough that it comes out a lot. We've accumulated most of the expansions now, and the options are quite interesting but don't fundamentally change much. Just more options.  The exception is the battlegrounds: domination expansion. I really enjoy the modular board and the ability to play with 3 players. Together, I rate them a 9.5.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">[ImageID=1609439]  This game deserves the hype.  The only reason I don't give it a 10 is the amount of time it takes to play a game and it's very hard to teach or get to the table with someone new.  That being said, this game is everything I want out of a game that pits two powerful mages throwing everything they have at each other.  Each game tells a unique story and if Mage Wars was a real-life event, each game would have several events from both mages shown on SportsCenter highlights.  I really love this game and if I never play again, I've gotten my money's worth out of it.  This is what I wanted Magic The Gathering to feel like.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">This is by far one of my favorite games I have ever played. The mages are unique and well balanced, there are mismatches.  It gives you the MTG or Yugioh fix that no other game does for me. It also eliminates all of the luck of the draw aspects that the other deck builders have. Building the deck can take any where from a few min to a couple of hours depending on your experience. The learning curve is quite steep and daunting to begin with. There is enough in the box for 2 players without expansions but will leave you arguing on who gets what. </comment>
    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">At first, Mage Wars seemed incredibly overwhelming and confusing to play. However, after our second play, my fianc&#233;e and I really enjoyed it and have found ourselves constantly wanting to play again. My advice would be to give it some time to get used to the rules and cards. We both are really enjoying it!   It's also really cool because of the amount of customization that can be done without having to buy any cards or anything. We haven't begun to scratch the surface with that. I like the fact that the company has videos showing how gameplay works. I think with a relatively complex game, it's a really great idea. The codex is also really helpful. Overall, it's a really well done game.   Also, the customer service with this game is great! I had a defective spell book, emailed customer service, and had a replacement in a few days!</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Wars Arena" game_id="101721" location="United States">A great 1v1 game. Highly suggest a second set for 1v1v1 or 2v2 games.  There is a large variety of cards and it is set up to support many different styles.  Game is a bit complicated and you have to remind yourself of rules once in a while but a great game that reminds you a bit of Magic: The Gathering with a tactical board set up.</comment>

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Australia">Brilliant. Low luck, 2-3 hours to play, plenty of tough decisions right from the start as you try to get from your initial loss-making position to a break-even position and eventually a profit. I can see why there are so many maps though, as I feel that (i) each map would play optimally with only a small range of player numbers, and (ii) map variety would add interest anyway.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">A brilliantly conceived and somewhat abstract game wrapped with a train theme and set of mechanics that works incredibly well. The game possesses a brutal economic system and bidding mechanic. All of the elements of Age of Steam combine to make this one of Martin Wallace's finest games.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Poland">2011-07-12 (rating 9):  9 for the game itself rather than this particular map.  I just love this game. And it has the "catch them all" expansions feel so there is always something to look for. (Sadly the expansions are very expensive considering components quality.)  I will rate the base map once I play it few times with more than 4 players.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Australia">Excellent game, sort of a melange of many different elements of various other games, but fun and deep with just enough of a random element.  Rulebook is not the best and could be improved, but with the FAQ here on the &amp;#039;geek it&amp;#039;s easy enough to work out what&amp;#039;s going on and fill in a few blanks.

Capostipite della "serie ferroviaria" di Wallace (gli altri sono Steam e Railways of the World), &#232; il classico capolavoro senza tempo (qualcuno dir&#224; che si vedono gli anni che si porta appresso..).   Age of Steam non perdona alcun errore, pena la possibilit&#224; di essere eliminati dal gioco (e questo pu&#242; accadere gi&#224; alle prime fasi, in seguito a scelte scellerate) e mette di fronte ad un continuo adattarsi al mutamento della mappa e alla situazione patrimoniale propria e degli avversari (grazie al particolare meccanismo dei prestiti da richiedere ESCLUSIVAMENTE prima dell'asta di inizio turno).  Scala diversamente bene a seconda della mappa scelta (ce ne sono decine) e non &#232; adatto ai neofiti (per i quali consiglio il pi&#249; "soft" Railways of the World) E' un gioco essenzialmente di pick and delivery, con una cattivissima asta iniziale e una continua sensazione di non avere tempo n&#232; soprattutto soldi per fare quello che serve.   Mi ripeto: un capolavoro.</comment>

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Canada">Really good game, but really heavy, and since I played my first game with three people who have played the game many times, I felt really lost and confused. I'm still not certain what the best auction strategy would have been. The scoring at the end of the game is really convoluted as well. It's pretty ugly to look at too. Strangely, despite all of these complaints, I want to try it again asap.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="France">too long ? sure ! but not really:  you'll not look at your watch while playing. too much things to plan, so many decisions.. i'm fond of this game ! </comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="Finland">AoS has a very good balance of strategy, tactics, intuition, and optimization. At its best with a group of equally skilled gamers, the game is quite unforgiving. At its worst (too much downtime) when played with people who have analysis paralysis tendency. I have played with 2-5 players, probably 4 players has been the most fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">Update: Great game I never play anymore. Not sure if I still have interest.  A great game. I like to fly by the seat of my pants and still come out ahead. Usually wind up coming in second that way but hey. Only good for times when I don't feel like socializing much, since most of the game is spent in silence staring at the board.</comment>

    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">This game won't get old for me. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is that it feels like a similar game many of the times I play it, but that doesn't make it un-fun. I would just like more options overall; the game is quite simple, and that makes it beautiful, but I would also enjoy some way to maybe pay an opponent to use their gems as well as double-gem cards or point-only cards to add some variety to the gameplay.</comment>
    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">36+ plays / 2,3,4 players.  LIKE: Great engine building, feels like it's stripped to the core, but it works. Great artwork, good depth, fast game. DISLIKE: Some randomness in the cards that come out. Level 3 cards don't move as much (2 player), so strategy is a little static with those cards. small level of luck involved. OVERALL: Very fun. A classic. I've seen different strategies prevail: use your reserves to block players, make a rush for the 2 or 3 level cards, Chip hoarding.</comment>
    <comment game="Splendor" game_id="148228" location="United States">Certainly an approachable incredibly produced game. Game play is very easy to understand: take chips or buy cards (or perhaps reserve a card). But there is a joy derived from buying cards, a tension in wondering if your fellow players will interfere (knowingly? unknowingly?), and a rush when your combination of cards lets you buy the 'expensive' things. It's very brisk - there's a snowball effect at the end which spins everyone headlong inside 40 minutes (or even less). I put it as a very original gateway game - nothing like Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne, but equal in stature and family fun.</comment>

Det er om &#229; skaffe flest mulig profesjoner til byen og dette oppn&#229;es gjennom &#229; skaffe de rette tingene (ja blir litt s&#248;kt &#229; kalle det ting, men det er for enkelthets skyld). Det finnes ogs&#229; en auksjonsdel i spillet. Vanskelig &#229; komme med direkte r&#229;d, for du m&#229; se ann hva de andre gj&#248;r.</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Canada">The biggest thing that surprised me about this game is how thematic it is. I was simply expecting a cool card game with pretty cards. Not only did I get that, but the missions, the choices you have, the cards, and the card effect all make so much sense thematically. If you are a Tolkien fan you will NOT be disappointed. The game takes you (and you band of heroes that you can choose) on a journey within Middle Earth with varying tasks, enemies, and locations to explore.   Another thing that surprised me was how great of a Solo game this is. Not too take away from the co-op aspect of this game - it is definitely one of the best - if not the best - 2 player (co-op) game I've played. But its by far the best solo-player game I've played (admittedly I haven't played very many, but I guess that's because I never appealed to me in the first place.)  If you've been researching this game, no doubt you've heard about plethora of expansion packs and something called 'deck-building.' As for expansions, I haven't purchased any yet, though I plan to because there is a lot more adventures that I'd love to go on! There's even a fan expansion with cards and quests to do with the First Age!  As for deck-building, my only experience with that has been with Pokemon cards back when I was a young kid :P I haven't actually put together my own deck yet, and before buying this game I'll admit I wasn't to stoked about it, but after getting a bunch of games in using the pre-made decks, I can see the appeal, and even necessity of it to get the most out of this game. I look forward to the day I get more cards, and can start putting together my own 'deck of adventurers' and go on more quests! All that said, I haven't done any of that yet and still enjoy this game immensely.  Anyways, I really think this is a well designed game. It really doesn't feel like a 'card game' to me but instead an adventure in Middle Earth. If that interests you, then I definitely recommend this game to you.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Philippines">My ultimate solo game :) its hard enough for me to recreate my decks. Got to play with fellow LOTR LCG fans as well, quite an experience.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Luxembourg">It is hard to love this game the first time you try it as there are not enough cards and the adventures are complicated.  But as you go along your imagination starts to fly and you try to build thematic decks.  A very enjoyable game that I think I will be playing for quite a long time.</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Spain">Seems like this is finnaly going to be my LCG. Story driven Quests were what I was starving for, and here they are. Different expansion decks telling a different story seem like a great idea. Overall mechanics intriguing enough.And the possibility to play it solo or cooperatively just sold it for me.  And Fantasy setting is my all time favorite. Of course, Lord of the Rings, my bible. When is it coming?  Finnally here. Living to my expectations so far, and that is a lot to say (not many games do). Narrative is here, quest stages feel like a story, every quest is like a different puzzle where you need to adapt your deck strategies to survive...  Plays great solo and looking forward to some cooperative games. And the art is fantastic. Now I can&#180;t wait for next chapters coming out.  Might make it to my Top 10 faster than I thought.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">Favorite game, and has been for 6 months or so. I will write more about this later. </comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United Kingdom">Only ever played this Solo but as a solo game this is fantastic. Can be a bit of a money sink if you collect all the expansions but there is hours, if not hundreds of play time here. Combines deck building (no single deck can defeat all quests) and excellent solo gameplay. Fantastic.</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">+ Plays surprisingly well as a solo game; The game draws you into the theme through the different scenarios. - Not worth playing with two unless the other has spent time making their own deck (common problem with LCGs).</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Germany">Just a brilliant game if you take the time to build decks and don't mind rebuilding them over and over again to manage the new challenges.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="Australia">Fantastic and addictive.  My favourite co-op.</comment>
    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="">A very good game which is so time-consuming on the one hand and expensive on the other hand that selling my childeren to some humans smugglers seemed the only solution to kill those two birds with one stone... luckily I have no children! (anymore?) Set-up usually takes quite some time and can be a bit flimsy. Theme is awesome. Mechanics are well-thought of and are tied with the story (E.g. Gimli's skill really feels like a perfect fit for Gimli).  Theme (artwork/story/...) 2/2 Gameplay (smooth play/player interaction/strategy&amp;tactics/depth) 5/5 Fun factor (can you afford a smile during play?) 2.5/3    Passage Through Mirkwood: Good quest to get to know the game (but more difficult than its DL suggests!) Wins/losses: 5/1  Journey Down the Anduin: used to be my favourite quest (when I didn't have much more than the core set). This quest isn't perfect, but when you get through the start, it becomes quite enjoyable. Wins/losses: 8/4  Escape from Dol Guldur: Random shmandom. I won this quest once, just because not one objective was guarded at the beginning (drew 3 treacheries). Very difficult quest. Wins/losses: 1/1</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">Love the game length, choices on game play and play from 2 to 5 players.  Ability to change the board setup is a real plus.  </comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">We love this game. The theme fits right in with what we like - the marketplace/bazaar feel. Being able to randomize the board also helps give it a lot of replayability. The short paths map that the game suggests you start with definitely eases you into learning how to play, but it does it old after only a few plays. Once you start doing the long paths, or just a random layout, it is a lot of fun. I also like the short turns, meaning it feels like it moves quickly, instead of waiting on other people for too long.</comment>

    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United Kingdom">Love this one. Dropping your workers off at various stops on the board and planning routes was interesting. Like that it is a race for gems rather than fixed number of turns. Have played as a 2 player and would recommend.</comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States"> This one clearly ranks as one of our favorite Euros. A worker placement game with simple rules and just enough strategy to keep you thinking from the first move to the last. You move about Istanbul (was Constantinople!) collecting wares and selling them or using them to buy the rubies you need to win the game. Along the way you gamble, have your near do well family go out &amp; do some business for you and even visit a beautiful fountain. The production is top notch and the theme is fairly strong if off-putting to some. We love it a lot. We are really hoping an expansion or two might come out because that will make this already great game a perfect 10 possibly. </comment>
    <comment game="Istanbul" game_id="148949" location="United States">A very unique puzzle that plays really smoothly and surprisingly fast. The game is about being efficient with your movements and finding a circuit that gains you resources and money, while picking your workers back up. There are many paths to victory. Players can have very different strategies and still be neck and neck at the end. Gameplay matches the theme really well, and the artwork is delightful.  The only thing I dislike is that near the end of the game, players can see who has won and how many turns it will take for him to finish. For that reason, it can be anticlimatic as players helplessly watch someone win when they can't do anything about it.</comment>
    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">Solves some of the problems I have with typical euro games. Rulebook was particularly pleasant. Player interaction can be quite interesting on this one. One of the most critical elements is driven purely by chance, making each round predictably unpredictable. Recommended by Evan S., Kevin S., and Essen Spiel reviews.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="Sweden">Complex and pretty tight game. You always want to do more than you can. Not very accessible, though, and I had to read the rulebook a few times and also watch a video or two before I got the hang of it. If it weren't for that it would have been a 9. EDIT: The game has grown on me and is now rated a 9.  This gets more fun the more we play it. Like all the choices. Great!</comment>

We are a Group of Strategy-Gamers (Agricola, le Havre, Terra Mystica, Caverna etc.)and we played it with Mike Keller and it was very convincing. Granja has a lot of interesting game mechanisms, you have many possibilitys which strategy you choose. All in all the game is very balanced and exciting till the end. The Cards make every game unique and open new ways. Also, the Design looks nicely. We had a lot of fun playing it and I can definitely recommend it. I will surely buy it as soon as it comes out!</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">This is a really great euro. Going to publish a full review soon, but the short version is that this is a consistently interesting game full of choices that matter, and has player interaction without a lot of meanness. The area control of the market stalls becomes very interesting in the mid to late game and this game gives a very real sense of progress that carries with it a sense of satisfaction. Can't recommend it enough to euro fans.   FYI: the game looks busy and the player aid is at first baffling, but it flows very well once you understand play and the player aid is incredible, one of the best ever made for a game of this weight.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United Kingdom">Great Euro game with plenty of choices each round.  I love how the cards have 4 uses and the player boards are designed to hole the cards revealing the relevant information.  Rules are simple enough and set-up is quite quick.  Solo rules are okay and the automa variant adds a much better experience.</comment>

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="Greece">An excellent design! The game is initially hard without the artificial obligation to feed or pay something every couple of rounds, which requires skill on part of the designer. It plays well, it is balanced.

    <comment game="La Granja" game_id="146886" location="United States">Fantastic Euro game. It incorporates classic elements from many other games, but creates something new and exciting with them. The 4-way cards are, simply put, awesome. The entire resource system is elegant and easy. Great player board, reference guide, etc. Nice wooden dice.  There's a little AP potential when trying to analyze all your cards - a hand of 5 or 6 cards means you're looking at 20-24 options. How do you string those options with what you already have out and what you could play in the future?  If you have ever liked a Euro, check this game out as soon as possible.  </comment>

There are tons of ways to score points, and none seem more powerful than others.  Everyone I've taught it to has enjoyed it.  great, great game.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Canada">Totally devoid of theme, drab artwork, convoluted ruleset, and yet this is a great game.  It scales from 2-5 players, it offers a myriad of possible strategies, and other than the introduction of bonus tiles, there is no luck.  I have almost no idea how to win this game, and yet I keep wanting to come back for more.  The goal of course is to score the most victory points and this can be accomplished in several ways: 1) bonus tiles, 2) placement of offices, 3) scoring of offices when trading routes are closed, 4) end scoring of controlled offices, 5) longest network of offices at the end of the game, 6) completed abilities, 7) network connection between the two end cities (forget their names), and 8) points scored from closing in the lefthand corner (forget the cityname).  The game also has several end conditions, the manipulation of these I think are one of the keys to winning the game: 1) 20 points scored during gameplay, 2) 10 completed cities, and 3) running out of bonus tiles.  On your turn, you have a choice between several different actions: 1) collect more cubes, needed for valuable placements, 2) move cubes on the board (a very important ability), 3) establish a trading route, 4) placing cubes/circles (traders or merchants),and 5) displacing traders or merchants (a confrontational aspect to the game).    This is a very deep game and yet it feels easy and "light" to play, gameplay is relatively quick.  It doesn't look original, just the opposite, but in actuality it is quite a unique game.  Don't overlook this one like I almost did.

    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Netherlands">Millions of ways to win, highly interactive, fast to set up, quick to play. An unique euro experience that is unmatched so far. A tactical and strategical gem. This would have been a 10 if it wasn't for the lack of theme and the awful 2-player game.   3.1</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="Germany">Ein Kleinod, welches ich relativ sp&#228;t entdeckt habe. Ich finde hier passt fast alles. Okay, das Thema ist vielleicht ein wenig aufgesetzt. Hansa spielt sich sch&#246;n fl&#252;ssig und hat keinen &#252;berfl&#252;ssigen Schnickschnack. Das man das Spielende selber ausl&#246;st, macht es sehr taktisch und man muss genau abw&#228;gen ob man lieber l&#228;ngerfristig oder kurzfristig plant. Ein sehr tolles Spiel, dass immer wieder auf den Tisch kommen kann.</comment>
    <comment game="Hansa Teutonica" game_id="43015" location="United States">Though the physical game and box are your typical "Ugly Euro", the mechanics are elegant and everything just works.  Looking forward to getting a lot more plays outta this one.  I do favor that suggestion that the bonus chips are removed for an entirely luckless game.</comment>

There are however few things that I don't like: 1) rules differences between regions/countries/tournaments/groups, 2) rule forbidding a game state to repeat which is theoretically very inconvenient (how to trace all the states in a long game?) but practically not that important.</comment>

I was first a Chess player so I can't forget my love for it but Go is also an excellent classic game. The big difference (that might frighten new players) is that here you put your pieces to the board where in Chess there are already there... Both of these games should be in every house like a deck of classic cards is.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="England">Really nice euro with lots to think about, and mistakes punished readily! The theme is strong, and the generations and death mean that you have to plan well to win at this game. Recommended.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="Malaysia">a unique take on action-selection, resource management, worker placement game. Quite similar to Orleans. You play as 4 generations of family, looking to make their mark in the village. On your turn, you can choose between crafting goods (yellow), adding/calling back family member (purple in front of the temple), harvest in farmyard (purple), becoming priest in the temple (brown), becoming politician in council chamber (red), travelling (green) or serving customers in market by selling goods (blue). You take cube (green, pink, orange, brown, black) from the action spot as resource to your personal farmyard (if black cube, just advance your time tracker 2 spaces) and may do the action. A round will finish when all cubes are removed from the main board. Then, the mass ritual is performed to pick who will become priest in the temple. The most unique &amp; interesting element in this boardgame that piqued my interest to buy it is that one of your family members would die each time your time tracker crosses the bridge. You should plan their death well to make sure they would be put into the village chronicle &amp; earn points by the end of the game. If not, they will just be buried in the normal grave behind the temple. Once either the chronicle/grave is full, the game ends. I like this game. It does feel like you are controlling a family of meeples. My first game was around 3-4 full rounds, maybe 20-30 minutes per player. It's not as point salad as Feld games as I thought. It has relaxing theme &amp; nice pacing. Just enough randomization for replayability. Certainly a keeper.  The meanest mechanism in the game would absolutely be the market, taking the action before your opponent can gather enough resources to be sold to the customers. Always love how vulnerable the meeples are in the game haha</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">Received as a birthday present in 2014.  A great game with a very interesting take on worker placement with the addition of the time mechanism. It's quite fun to put your meeples in the village chronicle as well as in the church bag and draw them out for mass (and I'm not religious). Definitely lots of choices and strategy. Can't wait to play again and to add the Village Inn expansion into it to see how it adds to game play.</comment>

    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="Canada">Another game that stepped it up with a great expansion, this game's big draw of course is the timely demise of your workers to earn points.  As innovative as the gears and worker removal of Tzolk'in?  Maybe!  But overall the game just isn't quite as gripping.  Although .. I do love pulling cubes from bags.</comment>

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Austria">Wow, do I love this game! I like it so much, that I'm ashamed I let it flew under my radar for so long. Maybe my tastes changed over the years, maybe I first needed to see it whether this game had any staying power or expansions... but, after finally playing it, I quickly realized, that this is going to be a contender for my favorite game of all time!  Imperial Settlers is a beautiful game. It has great wooden components, incredible artwork and a very cool theme, that I very much prefer to the post-apocalyptic one of its older brother. What I find the most exciting about it though is its strategical depth/ease of play ratio. You can explain the game pretty quickly, but beneath a bunch of wonderfully crafted mechanisms lies a game with a lot of choices to offer. The key element of this depth is, of course, the multi-use cards. Every hand in Imperial Settlers is a puzzle. Depending on your strategy, your faction or you specific short-term goals you need to figure out how put those cards at the best use. It might be difficult, you might do mistakes, but it's so damn satisfying when you do it right!  Yet this game has a whole lot more to offer than this! It has in fact nearly the perfect level of player interaction for me. In many video I've seen reviewers complaining either for the excessive meanness of the game or, at the opposite end of the spectrum, for its lack of player interaction. The reason for this opposite views is that the interaction really depends on you and on your playing style... and personally I find this to be really great, because I can adapt it to the taste of the other players at the table or to my particular mood that day. Yet the one thing that makes this game reach the next level is the factions! They are not just a player board or a card with a special power... they are a completely unique deck of cards, a totally different style of play. Each faction plays almost like a different games and this makes Imperial Settlers incredibly re-playable!  There, however, are a few things that might be bothersome to somebody. There's some luck of the draw, even if I personally think that it's not so relevant to invalidate the cool elements of the game. There's also a steep learning curve that might scare people away or even make them leave the table with the feeling that a particular faction is over-powered. That's a complaint I've heard a lot already, but I really disagree with it. I believe in fact that, when people think a faction is overpowered, more often than not it's because that one faction was being played by a player that knew the game, while the other by a player who didn't (or nor so well anyway).  Criticisms aside, all in all I think this an amazing game and one that, every time I play it,  leaves me with the desire of coming back to it soon. I can't wait to try out the expansions, the different factions, the deck building... there's just so much more to explore here! I can see this game slowly becoming one of my favorites games, if not my favorite of all time. It's just incredible! I love it!  Rating without expansion: 8,5.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Romania">This is one of the best card based civilization games until now. You have four rounds, which you start by drafting cards and then by acquiring the available resource you effectively lay them down in an orderly fashion to build up your county (Japan, Rome, Egypt or the Barbarians). You then may use if able the special abilities provided by these cards to buy more cards and lay down even more of them. Also there is a neat combat system in which you are able to destroy your opponents buildings or even to raize your own and collect some resources (wood) in case of shortage. The mechanics work well, althought the available four civilizations doesn't provide for much gameplay variability.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Romania">[b]After 6 plays[/b]: Imperial Settlers is a game that I found out about first by the commotion it produced in our local community when it was announced (many people pre-ordered it). After that, I heard that it somewhat takes after the "old" PC game The Settlers, I game which I liked and played while discovering videogames. This last thing made me pull the trigger and buy it. Oh, what a good choice!  I like card games (RFtG is my all time favourite), but I would love to play them less and more boardgames. This game scratches two itches: while building a tableau, you must create an economic engine and generate the resources needed for it.  There are so many pros: the wooden components (resource-meeples), the many ways you can use a card, the different strategies, based on the which faction you play.  Now to talk about the dark side: the downtime and the future of the game. I have played with a maximum of 3 players (just one of us was new to the game) till now, but it took too long for me to ever try it with 4 players (unless they are experienced players). Regarding the future of the game, it looks that it is heading towards a TCG/LCG path. I hate deckbuilding and if that will turn out to be true, I will stick with just the base game.  This is the best new game I have played in 2014, no doubt about it. The most interesting part is that my wife has won just one of the 5 games with have played till now and she still wants to play it.</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Russia">Love this game! From the cute look to those neat production chains you can build in it.

    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="United States">Excellent game, and by far the most accessible in the series (51st -&gt; New Era -&gt; Imperial Settlers).  Open-ended freeform asymetric tableau/engine builder where you try and score the most points in five rounds, so simple for people to pick up and conceptualize.  Surprisingly tricky learning curve, and lots of tough decisions to make.  More player interaction than one would expect, and can get somewhat spiteful depending on which cards come out.  Table talk is important.</comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Switzerland">I believe T&amp;E to be the ideal game, sitting somewhere between conquest and german mechanisms.  If you play tactical battle games (such as Risk), you'll notive that games tend to last for may too long. Units are generally numerous and fights are usually dice fests. All the more, if you play with 3 or more persons, player eliminations tend to occur before the end of the game. Tigris &amp; Euphrates provides you with the benefits of territorial conquest without those drawbacks. It allows a better pace through a subtile tile placement mechanism which replaces troops moves and offers a score system with which you can "loose a battle without loosing the war". If we consider the conflict resolution system, through tiles in hand, it favors deduction and instinctive play, in opposition to cold calculations. Those conflicts, which are almost "games within the game" are considered very carefully by all players because they have the bitter taste of sand for those who lose them and a wonderful flavor for those who win and for who the supremacy is revealed on the board. With practice, you can better estimate your chances of winnong and better "read" the board and your opponents placements. T&amp;E really develops itself through extensive play. You can improve your tactical skills and practice the art of bluffing, which sometimes allow to deal properly with a poor hand of tiles. At last, the game materials are splendid with those large wooden leader disks at the "color" of each of the player. Between the two versions of the game (german / american), i'm entirely for the older version which distinguishes by its sobriety and the easy-to-read board and tiles.  Among the blames set on the game, there is its difficulty which makes it a proper game for experienced players only, a lack of them (regularly argued) and the luck factor (the importance of the "red" color). If it's true that T&amp;E cannot fit everyone's needs, the other criticisms are, to my point of view, untrue. Reiner Knizia said, on Geekspeak, that the theme of civilisation raising and falling was at the very origin of the game. It is true that the game is very much streamlined but it was made towards improving the flow of the game and keep a certain simplicity. It does not hurt the joy of playing. At last, variety rules within the tiles in hand and statistically improbable situations do occur. Those elements provide length of play to the game. As games are played, you have to adapt to your hand as much as to the board and seek the advantages of both. All the more, monuments and treasure provide solutions to deal with the luck of the draw.  If I only had to make one statement against the game, it would be related to the turn order. As proved on the BGG interface, first persons to play have a double advantage of choosing their starting location and of being potentially able to play more than other players. This small drawback is the price to be paid for a very good game and it is up to the players at the table to remember it and compensate favor of destiny.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="Wales">I have played this a lot on the iPad, and I'm glad I held off on purchasing a physical copy until I was well-immersed in the hobby. It's a simple enough premise, but has very deep strategy and is too dry for most of my gaming partners. Ultimately, there came a point in my collecting, where I knew I needed a copy of this game for my collection to feel adequate - it's so weighty and significant a title. I don't suppose I will find other players for it often, but it is nice to have. The physical game looks beautiful too.</comment>
    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="">No argument. Dr. Knitzia master peace.  For me this is a perfect 10, specially the Mayfair 2008 edition that includes the doble sided board, the 4 civilization buildings and the Ziggurat tower expansion. No wonder why this game has been among the top 50 in the board game geek top 100 games evendoug it was first introduced on 1997.</comment>

    <comment game="Tigris &amp; Euphrates" game_id="42" location="United States">Solid strategic fun.  Yes, there's randomness in the blind tile choosing, but it's all where you play them.  Screwing over people is fun here.  The game takes a few plays to get the hang of.  In fact, it wasn't immediately apparent that it would work well as a 2 player game, as one person had a tendency to win by a lot.  But about the 3rd or 4th time we played, it became more even as we explored the strategies.  Yes, the theme is only there to help try and explain the rules, as it's mostly abstract.    Bump to 10.  After many plays here on the geek, I'd play this at the drop of a hat.  Or a hint.  Or an invitation.  I love this game.  But for a good, thought-filled evening, this will frequently be pulled out.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United States">A very inventive new take on a euro game. I love the mancala mechanic placed in this game making choices have a multi-faceted repercussion. Each turn feels like it's own puzzle to solve to figure out how not only to get points but how to keep getting points. The time mechanism makes other peoples turns impact your turn a lot. Mechanically this game feels wonderful.  The theme is something I like but doesn't seem to show much value in the game. It could have been themed to be anything really and still work.  This is a euro game through and through and a mechanically wonderful experience. </comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="United Kingdom">Amazing, amazing, amazing. Almost sandboxy in the freedom of routes you can take but there's a gently mounting tension throughout due to the jostling for the particular spots / tiles you want, the fickle demands of the people and the constant march of time. You'll have one or two primary focus points yet you'll want to respond to the changing board position. And all this has to be filtered through the delicious Mancala action selection. Fast became my favourite Feld - not as breezy as Castles of Burgundy, but ultimately more satisfying.</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="">Probably my favourite game. many many plays online and still enjoy the physical game every time I get a chance to play it!</comment>
    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="">One of my favorite games. Ingenious mechanism for making moves. Lots of options for actions with several good victory strategies. Very replayable. 2 negatives are that: 1. I don't think it works as well for 4 players - too slow, too long and there are less options for moves due to the board getting congested and potentially running out of some trajan tiles, and 2. there can be too much first player advantage if a player gets a doubler with a forum bonus. Excellent to play online at boiteajeux.net.</comment>

    <comment game="Trajan" game_id="102680" location="Canada">Probably Feld's most interesting point salad, with a little more theme than his other games too (although much of it is created in the theater of the mind).  Great integration of various mechanics, and really rewards a well thought out strategy.  I would say this is the heaviest euro on my shelf and sometimes I feel like tossing it in the air mid-game, which is the mark of a truly top tier experience in my opinion!</comment>

    <comment game="Russian Railroads" game_id="144733" location="United States">2-4(4)  Edit: Okay, so this is playing like a 10 right now. I'm sure the lack of a randomness and the small amount of engineers / scoring cards will possibly make the game run out of steam, but it's currently really fun to play. Namely, progressing along the tracks feel like you're unlocking achievements and the scoring each round, seeing how your gameplay is ramping the game up. Going from six points a round to a hundred does feel satisfying and like the nice culmination of a game's worth of strategy.  ---------------------------------------------------  Parts of it may eventually feel a bit scripted (grabbing Engineers and then money) or certain tracks might not be completely balanced (e.g., it seems that at least getting the bonus tokens from St. Petersburg is near mandatory) or the bonus tokens themselves might not be balanced and etc.  And, of course, this does become a bit of a concern as there is such little variability between games and no randomness after the setup (I guess maybe some uncertainty in not knowing which bonus cards have been removed as far as directing strategy). So there are certainly concerns regarding that and also the inability to kneecap a leader and etc.  Nevertheless, it was a very satisfying game to play. All of the components sort of mesh nicely and the whole scale of the game is pleasing and doesn't feel too artificially inflated. In some games the game will introduce something to artificially ramp things up (I think, quintessentially, the extra worker from Lords of Waterdeep fits this in a way to make later turns feel like more is going on). Obviously, the massive uptick in Russian Railroads is sort of artificially codified into the game, but it feels thematic and is rewarding.  Just a game that was lots of fun for me.</comment>

    <comment game="Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective" game_id="2511" location="Canada">One of a kind. Wonderfully written. I've thought about how it could be improved, but mechanically - there is nothing. There is nothing superfluous here, no fat - ffg this isn't. Really, the only possible improvement would be even better writing / case design but that would take a very significant talent indeed. ...or more cases - but that is not to say that there is not enough content here: we are admittedly slow players but it took us 6 hours to crack the first case. The second case only took 2 but we also spent two on the third without really getting to the crux of the matter... and those were some fun hours indeed.</comment>

The designer captures both the Fellowship of the Ring story involving taking the ring to volcano to destroy as well as the battle for Middle Earth and the return of the King and the ascension of Gandalf.  Much of the story (at least as much as I know it) is contained in the game while and you are playing a great game of resource, dice, and card management.  It's a bit long, but so were the books and so were the movies: you simply cannot tell this epic tale in a short setting.</comment>

I'm hoping to get in a good session where I get to play with them.   This version adds Percival specifically, which gives another role for the good guys to play as. And, although my first play didn't get to use it, Lancelot, Excalibur, and lady of the lake add more things to give information to the good guys.  All in all, whether this stays a highly rated game for me depends on how hard it is to get it to the table. </comment>

    <comment game="The Resistance: Avalon" game_id="128882" location="United States">The Resistance is fantastic with an energetic group of folks and the roles work so much better than the plot cards from the base game. They add information to the game in a more predictable, organized way, and they help folks realize the information and strategy inherent in the game.  I still think that, regardless, there is a lot of data to process (and that the first mission team shouldn't automatically be accepted and that the first mission should necessarily automatically succeed or whatever), but the roles do help this reality set in.  It does, as many games of this ilk, suffer if all players aren't all expressive, and the less sociable can get a bit suppressed, but otherwise great fun.</comment>

Before Crokinole I got a Carrom board, which a had to repair. I started some training but had to realize that Carrom is not easy to master and it needs a lot of practice to be able to realize controlled shoots. Finally I decided to buy a Crokinole board, model Wintersonne [url=crokinole.de]Crokinole.de[/url], which is much easier to play even with people who play it for the first time. With Carrom there is no way to play without serious practice. With Crokinole you can enjoy playing right from the start on (but practise will help also for Crokinole...). ___________________ \_______GER_______/ Habe die Wintersonne im November 2012 erstanden [url=www.crokinole.de] Crocinole.de[/url] und bin ganz begeistert. F&#252;r das sehr gro&#223;e Spielbrett muss man sich schon etwas einfallen lassen wo man es denn lagert wenn man nicht spielt, aber ich habe da eine sehr praktische L&#246;sung gefunden (siehe auch meine Galery). Ich habe es aufrecht an die Wand gest&#252;tzt aufgestellt und mit Filzstreifen vor Besch&#228;digungen gesch&#252;tzt.  Mit Carrom Gleitpuder ergibt sich ein deutlich anderes Spielgef&#252;hl. Sch&#252;sse k&#246;nnen damit sehr genau gesetzt werden aber der Krafteinsatz muss auch minimiert werden. Tolles Spiel! </comment>

I will say that it's not completely balanced by default, but people have come up with variants to make the game more fair. Once you're rocking these variants it's a really great game. The next obstacle is finding people willing to play with you (it's a thinking game and can be a little daunting at first) and finding the time to play.  Also, Fantasy Flight Games is a great company with superb customer service.</comment>

The main mechanic is stolen from Diplomacy, but the theme and flavor of the additional mechanics make it 100x more fun to play than Kissinger's favorite pastime.  In addition to the war game, you've got bidding, hand management, asymmetrical board positions, strong social play, and a light co-op element.  There's an expansion that makes it playable with 4 players, but you really want 5-6.</comment>

Takes and streamlines the best mechanisms of Agricola and specially Le Havre and adds a whole new dimension to these games by way of the spatial management of each player's town. In essence, it's an incredibly well crafted economic game: you'll be managing an economy from its humble, farming beginnings as it grows into a monster machine of churning out expensive crafts.  Those who are anguished by the perspective of feeding will also enjoy the fact that the 'feed' phases are cleverly disguised as another opportunity to grow (very profitably), and that you can plan on how much food/energy you will need well in advance.  This is a classic game and, for my tastes, the absolute best Uwe has to offer. A masterpiece.</comment>

    <comment game="Stone Age" game_id="34635" location="">A better worker placement game than Lords of Waterdeep in that theres more activities for you to do.  </comment>

    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="United Kingdom">An outstanding, easy to learn game for families and hardened veterans of the geek world. Packed full of character and style with an array of guild creations as you put together three heroes all with varying skills and power to battle through the monsters and enemy guild members to reclaim the city of Arcadia!  As you complete each campaign you'll amass an array of gold to spend on new equipment as you delve deeper into the city for your ultimate fight against the evil Lord Fang! A must have for any board game shelf!</comment>

    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="United States">My favorite game. Totally tongue in cheek design, but definitely a lot of strategy. Plus all the 'take that' action you want as you need to take out another player to win. Kill monsters for gold, then buy better equipment for the next game</comment>
    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="Germany">This is game is so much fun! It's exactly what I've been missing in my childhood and wish I had! Brutal, all-for-themselves dice-chucking fun. Love the different characters, the campaign mode and level ups. Fantastic minis. One of my all-time favourites! </comment>
    <comment game="Arcadia Quest" game_id="155068" location="United States">Very fun take on dungeon crawl.  I really like the single action turn as it keeps downtime very short.  In a 4 player campaign the PVE quests tend to be ignored or overlooked due to the ease of hunting down enemy heroes.    We finished playing through the base game campaign recently.  One player won 5 of the 7 scenarios and the other two were won by a second player.  I'm starting to worry that there is a snowball effect as those that win often have more coins and upgrade faster than other players. </comment>

    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Romania">I have liked the gameplay in 4 player game. Very alert,you need to compensate rapidly for the power tiles you would have loved to buy, but the other players have purchased them first. the 3 player game was fine. In a 2 player game the pace is slower, each player reacts to his opponet's move, it looked more like lying in wait for any  mistake your adversary might make. it is my oppinion that a 2 player game is longer than a 3-4 player game. After just 3 plays I want to get better at this and try a 5 player game.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="Mexico">Amazing game!!!!!</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">SWEET game - outstanding production value, great balance.  Sister game to Cyclades, but hits the table more often.  Love the Monster mini's!</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">Game is fast paced, with many battles, excruciating  tactical choices to make over those long dreamed of strategical moves... Victory will be hard earned on the black land !  Kemet is also great fun because mistakes do not have drastic impacts. Many big mistake will impact of course but you'll still be part of the game and very powerful.  Many thanks to Andrew for playing with us. He brought new ideas during game design and just is a great board game player.</comment>
    <comment game="Kemet" game_id="127023" location="United States">11-16-2013 Update for Santa:  10 Things We Like About Kemet: 1) Plays well with two -- one of our core criteria 2) Plays well with more -- nice to have!  3) Pretty. (Minis, board, tiles.) 4) Easy to learn 5) Good depth to time spent ratio. An hour for two feels satisfying. 6) Mechanics feel streamlined and slick. Mechanics flow nicely together, and it's easy to teach and understand. Things feel like they make a lot of sense! Light on luck -- you control your destiny. 7) Enjoyable and logical victory conditions! (You win when you attack more, and attacking more is fun.) 8) Easy to get people to play. Looks exciting. Cool factor.  9) Each game feels very different.  10) Direct interaction - gobs of it.    ---  Super fun. Each game is very different, and it is fun to explore new power tile combos. I've played this mostly as 2 player, so as long as we actively explore new strategies, we don't get stuck in a rut. Mechanics are tight and feel streamlined.   Games always feel close. Plays fairly quick as 2 player, but a pain to set up (good thing we can keep it on the table and would want to play several times before cleaning it up).</comment>

    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="United States">The deduction is brilliant but the rest of the game even more so.  Theme is the best.  This game is the best of everything I love about both deduction and worker placement, with tremendous art, humor, theme ... everything.</comment>
    <comment game="Alchemists" game_id="161970" location="">Very original and refreshing game! Very surprised with the quality of the components, excellent! One of the best deduction games out there! The app is really necessary in this game. This seems to have a bit of the CGE's game mechanics in here, and also artwork. The artwork is from the same guy who did "Dungeon Petz". The select player order and draw cards accordingly is very similar to "Last Will". The sell to adventurers potions is very similar to sell petz to costumers from "Dungeon Petz". Vlaada did have a participation on the game after all. Despite complaints have not found this game to be too long, nor does it drags itself. It plays at a very good pace, the typical round goes like this: usually all players go for at least 1 ingredient card (takes 20 secs for all players), then 1 player uses the sage (takes 2 secs), then 1 or 2 players sell, (takes 5 mins max - because of dedution aspects), then the artifact buy (takes 30 secs - reading included), debunk is not often used (not on the first 3 out of 6 rounds), then 1 or 2 players publish or endorse theories (takes 1 min), then players test on student (may take 10 mins if all players go there), and lastly the drink action, just 1 person usualy goes there (takes 1 minute). So I really don't see how the game drags. This game is underrated here on the geek.</comment>

Good components, the mat is amazing, and the game mechanics just thrust you into exciting cooperative and thrilling game play. A must have.  (edit to add)I have to say, the more we play this, the more enjoyable it is for me. Yes it is fun, but it is actually exciting and stressful. The solid mechanics really let the theme saturate the game experience. We especially love the times that we are certain that we are about to fail, and we manage to eek out a miraculous victory.  </comment>

    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="United States">Excellent game.  First game with 5 players lasted 3.5 hours.  The players were not hardcore gamers.  Everyone had a good time even though it was a long game. Player ages were 45, 35, 17, 16, 14.  1 male, 4 female.  Pros: Easiest rulebook to read and find information ever. Logical layout of bits. Does not feel fiddly. Single player was also enjoyable for me.  It is a "can you top your score" type of single player game. Very quick set up of game and very quick take down. Leaves you with the "I want to play again" feeling after playing it. Tactical players will enjoy.  Cons: Game bits could be better quality, but are not as bad as some people say. You may not be able to "play it again" after playing it because of the length of time to play. Strategic players will not enjoy.  I have not played through the ages, but I have played 7 wonders.  This game feels like 7 Wonders in spirit.  This is the first worker placement game I've played/gotten.  update:  playing this 2 player is pretty enjoyable.  I play this with one of my nieces often.  She likes it. It takes about 1 hr as a 2 player game, pretty consistently.   </comment>
    <comment game="Nations" game_id="126042" location="">[With Dynasties]  Faster than Through the Ages, I think, more variable.  Less deep and strategic, but a very very solid game I believe.  The end is hyper-calculational, but you can't have everything.</comment>

Lots of player interaction with ever changing early, mid and endgame leaders.</comment>

    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">This was one of those games that you play and wonder where it has been all of your life.  Right before BGGCon 2013 I played an epic scenario with some friends from the local game group.  At this point I have gotten pretty jaded overall when it comes to new games but this one was an instant hit.  At BGGCon I ended up playing a dozen or more scenarios and a friend and I ended up stickering 2 expansions just so we could get a chance to play the cool Spartan scenarios.  I ended up buying a complete set from a guy selling his and it was in excellent condition and saved me a lot of stickering.  I am really looking forward to trying out all of the scenarios in this game and getting to explore this deceptively simple game system.  I am still at the point where I am learning something new every game, which is exciting for me.  I am however looking forward to the point where I have all of the minor rules down solid and I can run Epic Scenarios for friends.  If you are on the fence do not hesitate, this is a great game and very worthy of getting in to, even if you just go for the base game.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="England">Superb.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Canada">If you have a thing for the Ancient period you would be doing yourself a disservice by not getting this game. It plays quickly and conveys exciting thematic information through simple rules. The expansions are good, but honestly, there is enough in the original box to last most people at least a year.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="Japan">Still now most likely the best simulation of battle available, deceptively simplistic seeming at first, however when employing historical battle formations and strategy, the system amazingly comes to life and adds a depth to the gameplay that you will not find in other wargames.  Thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining and educational experience all at the same time, most likely will remain as my all time favourite for quite some time.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United Kingdom">;) "while C&amp;C feels a lot more gritty and real" (c) cornjob 2006  All the CCA series feature top quality scenario design.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">More detail and strategy than the other C&amp;C-based (Memoir, Battle Cry, etc) base games.  But there is enough C&amp;C that if you have played one, it's easy to catch on.  Very good because you really have to think through your moves more.  Not as much "gamey" moves as other C&amp;C-based games.  You focus more on your formations and playing the cards in your hands in the optimal order to carry out your plans.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United Kingdom">This is the best "light" wargame. EVAR.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United Kingdom">Brilliant port of Memoir 44 from ww2 to the Punic Wars of long ago. Nice solid wooden blocks, a basic board, terrain tiles, and some naff black plastic dice and a deck of nice cards make up the game. Get it.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">Best of the series. Multiple unit types make this a more complex game than Battle Cry or M' 44, but adds tactical depth. Blocks with artwork on the stickers are better than unpainted figures. (As well as any that I would Paint.) Dice could be better, but are usable. Upping my rating. This has become a favorite.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">I own all three games in the Command and Colors system and love them all, but Ancients is by far my favorite.  The variety of units adds alot of depth and strategy to this game.I highly recommend this title to anyone, especially those interested in Ancients.</comment>
    <comment game="Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients" game_id="14105" location="United States">I'd like to own a block game.   This seems to be a good place to start. </comment>

    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="New Zealand">Finally found a city-building game that I really enjoy. It feels thematic all the way through, and the interactions between tiles make sense. Everything pulls together to form a game that rewards good strategic and tactical play. With so many tiles available, it offers good re-playability. The association of tiles with those in other suburbs provides some form of interaction between players, and is pretty thematic too. I really feel like I'm building a suburb in this game -- brilliant design! </comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Another go-to game for my partner and I.  </comment>
    <comment game="Suburbia" game_id="123260" location="United States">Just a excellent game. Suburbia is a sim city/suburb game that involves drafting hexagonal tiles into your growing suburb. The tiles trigger powers when placed adjacent to other tiles and you want to build synergies that compliment your play and help you achieve hidden and public objectives. Of course, you also need to pay attention to other players and sometimes purchase tiles to block them. So the game is not just a multiplayer solitaire. the score track is also an interesting mechanic because you are penalized as you progress which you need to account for. This keeps you from growing unchecked and affords other players a chance to keep up. Suburbia contains a lot of interesting and I dare say relatively novel/uncommon mechanics that really help it both stand out and be a good game. It was designed by the same person who did castles of mad King Ludwig (very different game), and is a Mensa select. As far as I am concerned, suburbia adds credibility to the Mensa select award. Bravo bezier games.</comment>

    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Australia">The cards add colour to the game and the game remains reasonably balanced throughout so even if you are behind you feel you can catch up.  Very clean mechanics. The only improvement i would like to see is some tweaks to make it easier to get the three VP spaces for the Tsar to take control and put the russians on the slippery slope to the Treat of Brest-Litovsk.</comment>
    <comment game="Paths of Glory" game_id="91" location="Norway">Learning how to play this now. So far it has been a lot of work just getting the rules down (not to mention all the exceptions to the rules). I will need to spend a lot more time with the game to be able to play proficiently, and right now that feels very daunting. This game just might be a bit too much for me at this stage.  EDIT: I finally feel that I have a decent understanding of the rules and basic strategic considerations. And I absolutely love the game. An extremely engaging and intense game that unfortunately requires a lot of patience while learning it.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Realms" game_id="147020" location="Hong Kong">I'd placed more than 10 kickstart orders and Star Realm is the first one arrived in full at the promised time frame. I'm not just looking forward to play the game, but will also look forward to other kickstart games by the same publisher. Well done!  Played the first games today, it can be learned in 5 minutes for gamers, and even non-gamers can easily grasp it. Fast paced, well balanced, love it!  A year from receiving of the game and it's still my favourite. It has replaced bridge to become my daily mobile-phone game, and still enjoy it very much after nearly a thousand plays (mostly on mobile).

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Canada">Age of Steam lite (sort of), which means tile-laying (tracks), route-planning, tough economic decisions (not as tough as AoS), and a strong theme (unlike AoS).  A very thematic, overproduced game about building up a railway empire.  It's definitely a revised version of Age of Steam (AoS), but has noticeable differences in addition to its many similarities.  For starters, the game plays 2-6, which is a big plus, and it is much easier to jump in and play.  In other words, although this is a high strategy game, it is much less gruelling than AoS, which is a good thing for beginners, and even myself who rates AoS very highly.  Gameplay involves getting money (shares to start usually) in order to build track, in order to ship goods, which nets you real money, as well as points.  There is an auction for player order, then you have 3 turns each per round, but of course you want to do much more than just 3 things, as does everyone else.  You can buy track (and the one-link limit makes the game much more accessible, as people can't be immediately locked out of certain regions), you can ship a good (only one per turn, making it again harder to completely drain resources immediately), or select a card (and then possibly use it).  The cards range in ability, but of course you can always bid higher to have first choice.  You also have a tycoon card which is a hidden bonus victory condition for you, if you achieve it.  Taking shares is simple- you just take as many as you need, but you have to pay $1000 each round, and they are minus 1 point per share at the end of the game.  Tough yes, but not as devastating as in AoS.  You also make "real" money sooner in this game, and thus don't feel absolutely broke the whole game, although there is an income reduction that occurs only if you get way up in points.  Overall this is an awesome game if you like AoS, as you actually want to play the game, rather than subject yourself to an exercise in economic decision making torture (re: AoS).  That's not to say there aren't tough decisions in Railroad Tycoon (RRT), it's just that the consequences are less stringent.  I think with more plays RRT will outshine AoS for me, in large part because it will see the table more often and reach a larger audience of players.  Own the [boardgame=30450]Railways of Europe[/boardgame], [boardgame=87627]Railways of Mexico[/boardgame], [boardgame=42964]Railways of England &amp; Wales[/boardgame], [boardgame=72267]Railways of the Western U.S.[/boardgame], [boardgame=72268]Railways Through Time[/boardgame], [boardgame=131386]Railways of North America[/boardgame], and [boardgame=99692]Event deck[/boardgame] expansions, which definitely breath new life into this great game.</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Australia">This really is a Great game,   theres luck in the cube draws, operation cards and bonus cards. But there is alot of strategy and tactics involved to win.  I've owned this game for a couple years now and I still consider it my favourite game.  It's got amazing replayability and a bunch of offical expansions. and dozens of unofficial ones.  You can't go wrong with this game!</comment>
    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="United States">[ImageID=1020395]  What do you mean we start with no money! This is just a beautiful game with great strategy too.  I fell in love with my first play and it was too long before I finally got two more plays in on the same day, and I loved it even more.  Great gameplay and it looks great on the table too. </comment>

Easy to learn. a Age of Steam Light, that you can play with non expiriens gamers, because the heavy calculation you have to make in almost every turn i AoS is gone.

    <comment game="Railways of the World" game_id="17133" location="Norway">It's one of my favorite games. Both on the computer and the board game. It's got great game mechanics. Easy to learn. Few extras that doesn't really make someone win or loose. I've got the first release, and the board got a few flaws. The blue is too similar to black and purple, and it bends/warps so you get huge gaps. This doesn't ruin the gaming experience at all.  Tip: you need a large table to play on. An average kitchen table is not wide enough. It's bigger than a game of Twilight Empirium.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">I love this game.  The card system's well realized, elegant, and loads of fun.  Tactical combat, wild swings of fortune, endless re-playability, no $85 200pg rulebook...</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Spain">Dise&#241;o perfecto, con reglas sencillas, claras y precisas. La incertidumbre lejos de ser un handicap, refleja el combate t&#225;ctico a la perfecci&#243;n. Y es que el campo de batalla no es posible controlarlo. Quiz&#225;s se pueda echar de menos alg&#250;n que otro tanque.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">I love it! Even though some things seem underpowered or even futile at first (namely, ranged combat), everything has its use and place. Besides, the real point of the game is recreate the feel of a war movie, with lots of chaos surrounding your units, who run for their lives towards their seemingly insurmountable goal.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Very playable game with rules that are much less intimidating than they seem at first blush.  Replayable to the extent that card draws and random events make every game different as well as random scenario generation possibilities.  What seem like minor differences in unit capabilities do create significant opportunities for each nationality but these differences can be subtle and the right way to take advantage of them must be learned the hard way.  BIN: Not for sale or trade</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">Best game in a long time.  Adds the chaos of battle with beautiful artwork and good game rules.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">This game has a cinematic feel at times, and while anything can happen, it rewards good planning and tactics. The card driven element makes this frustrating, but in a good way. Chad did a fantastic job. Personal preference is for Europe and Med editions. While I enjoy Pacific (it IS a bit different -- in a good way), I prefer the European theater more.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United Kingdom">Superb system.  A few little niggles but the "gestalt" is incredible. No wargame creates the atmosphere of chaos and unpredictability like CC.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">First game I bought after being away from wargaming for ~20 years. CC blew my mind as to what a wargame could be: fast, interactive, intuitive, and challenging. Time is elastic. Play the same scenario five times in a row and it&#8217;ll turn out different every time due to the cards, events, and variable objectives. Near infinite replayability with the Random Scenario Generator, not to mention the 100+ scenarios available between the base games and expansions. The rules and mechanics are ridiculously tight. And best of all, it generates sticky narratives unlike any game I&#8217;ve ever played. A masterpiece. </comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">I keep trying to find something I don't like about this game and I can't. My first 10.   This game isn't as random as many people make it out to be. With proper hand management and a little bit of card counting you'll find that you'll be able to do much of what you want to do. Personally I find the mechanics for hand management (playing actions, skipping turns to discard) very stimulating. That's not to say it's not random at all, just that the randomness is very well implemented and you can mitigate it with smart play. Most games where both sides make good decisions seem to come down to the wire which often won't happen in a truly random game.  I really like the fluid, sometimes non-linear way that the game models time and to some extent location. I also love how the card play creates a sense of uncertainty for both players. Nice fog of war.  Between fire/maneuver, hand management, bluffing, multiple victory conditions, random game length, and scenario special rules there are a ton of things to consider every turn which makes this a very engaging, satisfying system. You can keep playing and learn something every time you play. With all that plus a ton of scenarios in the expansions and the random scenario generator it also has lots of breadth.  The Initiative Card is amazing and I wish more games were aware of how swingy their dice results can be and included something similar to mitigate extremes.</comment>
    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="United States">This is an excellent 2 player squad based infantry combat game. Sure, there is some frustration with a card driven game and lacking the order card you need... but thats war. Confusion rules the battlefield, and the army that manages/overcomes the confusion is the victor.</comment>

    <comment game="Combat Commander: Europe" game_id="21050" location="Brazil">The best squad-level wargame. And all expansions are good. This is actually the best game in my collection.  I've been searching for the perfect game of tactical combat and Combat Commander is the closest I got from finding perfection.  Things I like about CC:  1. Easy rules. It takes 4 or 5 plays for you to internalize them all. But after that, you don't forget them anymore; 2. You can't do everything anytime you want. The card driven order and action mechanisms allow for some command confusion in the heat of battle, and that is a big plus in my book; 3. The random effects and events. I love them, for they will assure that no game will be equal to the last; 4. Immense variety of (beautiful) maps and (well designed) scenarios; 5. It really tells a story.  Better than... Tide of Iron, Lock'n'Load, ASLSK, Conflict of Heroes, Sergeants, Heroes of Normandie.  A freaking Masterpiece. </comment>

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Sweden">Heavy strategy game with mechanisms that make sense thematically. Everything is connected and the game is elegantly designed making it rather easy learning the rules and getting started. Superb quality components and beautiful visual design enhances the thematic feeling of this rather dry (in a good way) game. If you like low chance european style games that allow you to feel creative and that reward both tactical and strategic thinking, this might be for you.  I will keep it. Forever. Can't stop thinking about it.  More thoughts after more plays: Everything is so damned interconnected in this game that making a really informed decision requires time... This game has felt heavier the more we've explored it. Actually, if heaviness is judged by factors that should be taken into account when in making a decision, it's the heaviest I've played.</comment>
    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="Netherlands">Yeah, well... I have devoted 2 (!) reviews to this game, and I managed to play it over 10 times in 2 months.

    <comment game="The Gallerist" game_id="125153" location="United States">I saw this at Essen and wanted to buy it but it was 8 lbs, too heavy to pack in suitcase. That night I preordered it from Funagain games and got it in the mail 1 month later.  Edit 1/2016. I have since played this game 3 times, and would play it more if the game was shorter (and more than 4 players).  The mechanics seem to follow Vital's style: you do a simple action and there are many chain re-actions that follow. Which a very good thing in the type of games I like to play.  </comment>

    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United Kingdom">This game gets an immediate 10 out of 10 purely because I have not found a single person amongst those friends and family that usually hate boardgames who don't absolutely love it - amazing! Oh plus it's just great fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Europe" game_id="14996" location="United Kingdom">The best base version of Ticket to Ride (the Europe map is better than the basic American one). It will become a household name in our lifetime, and is something every family or play group should have.   Again, Europe is better than the original/10th Anniversary map and rules, but for smaller playgroups of couples or threes the Nordic base game is also recommended. Europe is still better however and more easily integrates with the map pack expansions. </comment>

    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="United Kingdom">Steam in its basic form is the excellent train game that combines all the good elements of Age of Steam and overcomes all the bits that don't work quite so well in Age of Steam.   For example: the replenishment of resources to a city can now arrive in a package with some choices and not disrupt the game with luck; the turn order is predefined by previous choices rather than a bidding war; and you take loans out when you need then rather than planning for a potential eventuality. And all this works to streamline the game and make an already good game even more playable. Magnificent.</comment>
    <comment game="Steam" game_id="27833" location="Spain">Juegazo de Wallace; menos bonito que Railroads of  the world y con un sistema de juego mas complejo; El desaf&#237;o como juego de pick and deliver y sistema econ&#243;mico es mayor.  Muy muy recomendable.  Aunque en principio no es jugable en pareja , existen mapas y variantes que hacen posible el disfrutar del juego.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Canada">Individual action/optimization strategy game with an auction phase central to each round.  You're a spice trader who has VERY limited actions to get spice to ship, ships to ship the spices, money to purchase new and helpful items, action cards that allow you special benefits, and risky ventures to find new and valuable spice colonies.  Each turn you have to decide if you're going to advance (which you need spice and ships to do), or if you're going to "cash in" at the particular level you're at (which you often need to do).  The further you advance, the more points you get, and the greater the benefits when you "cash in".  You'll always want money, because it's crucial to purchase items in the auction phase, plus most money is worth points at the end of the game.  You won't be able to resist grabbing action cards, even though their benefits encompass a very wide range, and they're also worth points at the end of the game.  And who can resist trying to found new spice colonies, since they not only give you points, but also valuable spice storage capabilites.  You're also tempted to move down the columns evenly, in order to moderately increase points across the board, and to obtain the coveted extra actions, but there is also the desire to go deep in a column to further increase points and obtain free action cards.  The auction phase is central to the game, has some innovation to it (re: the flag-bearer), and it actually works exceptionally well from 2-4 players.  In fact, the overall game plays equally well with 2-4 players, and ranks among the more strategic and most requested games by myself, my wife, and my friends.  </comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Canada">It's a very enjoyable playing experience.  Planning ahead is rewarded in this game and it's.  I like it because I was able to formulate a strategy and carry it out.  As with most good game, there is always something more you want to do on your turn. Based on one 4 player game. --June '07</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United Kingdom">The best new game I have played in 2004. The blending of resources is sublime.   The immediate view of its quality was to compare this game with Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence, both of which it resembles in various ways.   While there is some solitaire planning, you do need to follow what others are doing and the auctions of course do involve all players.   Even after playing this a few times, there appear to be multiple routes to victory, which suggests the game is as promising as it feels.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is a 10 game for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="Hong Kong">A hobby gamer's game, with Florence's auctions + actions (but with extra actions), Genoa's trading tower (modified), Industrial Waste auctions, Cities &amp; Knights level-up (but without the resource dice).  Many different strategy paths.</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">Cannot play this game enough.  Just the right amount of auction (which I often don't care for) and a good amount of building up your resources.  Basically you're limited by action "points."  And you can't do enough on your turn -- I love it!</comment>
    <comment game="Goa" game_id="9216" location="United States">A much better game than Princes of Florence because of the more free flowing nature of the game (more actions). It is a bit of a multiplayer solitare game but that doesn't bother me.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture" game_id="128621" location="United States">I like almost everything about this game. I immediately wanted to play it again after finishing my first game.</comment>

    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United States">When my husband and I saw the Dice Tower review we were very excited. "What? RoboRally plus Zombicide plus Twin Tin Bots?!" We marked the date on the calendar when we could order it. When the day came the Riot Games Website could hardly handle the load. I had to sign up for an account so the process would be quicker and I could get through. I made it! When the game arrived and we opened the box, the components and packaging were like no others we had seen - every reveal of a layer inside the box was followed by oohs and aahs of total delight. And the game play even exceeded all of our expectations. Our fellow players said, "whee can I get this game?" An immediate rating of 10 in all respects. Yes. Buy it. It is more than worth every penny.</comment>
    <comment game="Mechs vs. Minions" game_id="209010" location="United Kingdom">Debated a long time with myself if this really deserves a 10 but the truth is that the more I play it the more I love it. Production is outstanding (even if the first printing has a few typos and mistakes here and there) but really the gameplay is so much fun. Having a blast with this right now, a solid 10 is the only rating I can give it really.</comment>

    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="Australia">One of my new favourite games, this has so many interesting and involved mechanisms that just drag me into this world and want to play with the bluffing and alliance-making of Cosmic.  The aliens are all highly varied, and have a load of interesting ways to play and changes to existing rules, which really do stop games getting dull.  100% recommendation!</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">Probably the only game to pull off a system that balances through player action alone.  Every game is different!</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">What a fantastic game! It's one of those games where you attack with your dudes to take your opponents' spaces, but you cannot specifically choose the person you can attack or negotiate with on your turn, and each player has a totally game-breaking special power. Really fun game; some of its best elements are: -It plays in about an hour. -Easy rules; anybody can learn it. -Every game will be totally different with the large variety in player powers and flares. -Interaction between players is the heart and soul of the game. -Really crazy stuff that seems broken, but surprises you with the ways it can be both used and countered by creative players.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">Favorite game hands down.  Has all the elements to make player interaction hilarious, cut throat without being too mean, bluffing, laughing, crazy rule breaking.. without being imbalanced. Seriously, every game we think there is a guy who is going to win b/c his power is so overpowered, but it never works that way.. some sneaky person will work their way to a victory through subterfuge.    We pull this game out almost every other play group session.. With over 40 games that I absolutely love to play that is saying a ton! The most replay-ability of any game, add a rule, variant etc and the game still works.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="Australia">Somebody said, I'd rather play Cosmic Encouter?  The ultimate negotiation game, with infinite replayability - Fantasy Flight is the definitive version.  Will play it anytime, anywhere, just ask.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">With the abudnance of alien races, flares and card combinations truly anything is possible in this game. The offensive/defensive alliances always creates a fun competative atmosphere for trash talking. I love that an 'encounter' is forced every turn with the destiny deck, it keep the pace of the game going. While "unbalanced" doesn't even begin to describe this game, it forces you to ally with others and use your cards as best as you can to make up for it, it is a super well polished and fun game.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">Love the  alien powers, player interaction and surprise card play.   Feels like a party game, but with plenty of depth and choices.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">Classic. Everything about this game is great. I play this whenever we have 6 at game night, and it never disappoints me. </comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="">A study in chaos theory. At first glance it may seem like an unpredictable and disorganized mess. However, there is a measure of order in the chaos in this game. But oh, the hilarious moments the gameplay invokes, the looks on the faces of your four opponents when you singlehandedly destroy their fleets... Never there is a dull moment Cosmic Encounter.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">No two games are ever the same. Seriously. Never. Make alliances, break alliances, fake alliances - it is just so easy to enjoy this game. So much of what makes CE great is the fact that strategies and mechanics abound, yet they feel so organic and are never pushed upon the players. You can have all of the RPG fun of being a character, complete with lawful, chaotic, and neutral, good, evil, and true, without the game spelling it all out for you. Be who you want to be! Play how you want to play! Every player will have a chance to compete and win, whether you like battle, negotiating, or trickery. Quite possibly the best game ever, but not a perfect game; sometimes the chaos can be a bit much and create unnecessarily long or frustrating games. However, the highs outweigh the lows and no other board game is quite as thrilling.</comment>

Or if you're sensitive, then don't play it either. Or if you only like brain burners, you should avoid it then too. However, if you like people, aren't easily offended, and can handle a fun game based around interaction instead of complex optimization then this is the best game ever.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">This one surprised me! This game is only for a group that loves strong player interaction. It is absolutely random, absolutely broken, and absolutely a blast to play. </comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">I've played Cosmic since the Mayfair edition and just keep coming back for more.  The chance to play a power I've never played before (or at least a combination I haven't seen) is compelling.  The game itself is simple and easy to teach, the aliens create all the complexity and you'll only see 4-5 in each game.  This game will never get stale.  I recommend the expansions for the additional alien powers, but Incursion is really the only must have.  The defense deck is just too great an addition to pass up.</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">This game is purely based off player interaction.  If you think the mechanics carry games, this is not for you.  If you love playing with friends and they are the reason games are fun, this is for you!</comment>
    <comment game="Cosmic Encounter" game_id="39463" location="United States">Possibly the best iteration of this classic game and one of my all time favorites.</comment>

    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="">Excellent, dynamic strategy.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United Kingdom">Played many times with different player counts, feel like I need to try it again, OVER and OVER. GREAT in all configurations! Lots to think about, but has a little something for everyone. Amazing mix of strategy and tactics and keeps you tense throughout. I love the feel I get from this game. Will my preprogrammed actions work out this turn? Will somebody block me? Did I place the tokens in correct order? Do I use my precious order for my own gain or do I "waste" it to block my opponent? Ugh! So much to think about. Just love it! One of the longest games I own and yet one I have played the most! Miniatures definitely help a lot to empathise with the little guys that are about to die! (or survive). Very emotional game for me :)  </comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="">LIKE:  - very high production values and detailed artwork - deeply strategic in every aspect - setting up the board is a fun and strategic part of the game - asymmetrical yet balanced factions - very tight gameplay - combat is interesting and fun - really fun and powerful cards - bluffing - unforgiving of mistakes  DISLIKE:  - unforgiving of mistakes - an 8-round game can run very long - downtime in a four-player game is substantial</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Australia">A truly great asymmetric war game. One of my top games.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="Germany">One of my favourite game of all time. Set in the WH40k universe, the different factions plays wonderfully different to one another in a Star Craft-esque strategy game. The game inplements a genius battle mechanics that cleverly utilises a mix of dice and cards, awarding well planned card-play stradegies and keeps the tension high. SOOOOOO good.</comment>
    <comment game="Forbidden Stars" game_id="175155" location="United States">Things I like: -Secret Order Token System (similar to A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, but better IMO) -Works very well with 2 players -Engaging Dice/Card Combat System that keeps luck from playing too large a roll in battles -Combat Card "deck building" system -Modular Board -Unique factions -Awesome components -Stellar Artwork (pun intended)  Things I don't like: -I'm not playing it right now -I won't be able to play it tomorrow -I won't be able to play it the day after that . . . .</comment>

It has everything that I want in just enough of a portion to keep from being overwhelmed. Worker placement, variable actions, resource management, player interaction and, my God, the puzzling!  I see this making it to my table in solo and multiplayer iterations quite a few times in the coming year.</comment>

There is a lovely richness in the art and components. Absolute keeper.</comment>

    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="">Initial rating, after playing it ones. However I am quite sure the initial rating will be the final rating. The rules are straight forward, the number of possible action and interaction is overwelming. Therefore we missinterprated some rules ;-). The circumstance will be fixed in the next round. Until now: One Two-Player game and two solo round. I eaven enjoyed the solo round more.</comment>

    <comment game="A Feast for Odin" game_id="177736" location="">It's incredible how many thing you can do in "a feast for odin". You try to manage your group of vikings, doing whatever they did in real life (ex. Fishing, hunting, exploring, melting etc). The main board has more than 60 differnt actions and the mechanics that allows you to chose from them, it's really interesting. Every space on the board has a different requirement. To use the actions of the first column you need to spend a single viking of your color on it. As before, the second column need 2 vikings as the third one need 3 and the fourrh need 4. That machanics it's so strong in its strategy of worker placement and gives you many different way to use your vikings on the main board. It's a box full of components, starting from more than 400 "goods token", to many tiles for the players who wan to live a game about exploring the isle that vikings discover in the past time. But you need to be careful! It's not easy to get into the strategy mechanism! You have so many thing to do and in your first play it is possible that you finish it with a negative result! Why? Beacause in the first gameplay you probably want to try different way to increase your victory point as much as you can, but it's the best to don't get them. On the other hand, next you will notice that paying attention to a single or double way, gives you more strenght in some phase, like passing your time exploring the sea like a viking! Yeah, so much to do, but you have to chose carefully to don't get stuck in your own strategy! My advice is to experiment as much as you can from the first gameplay and stay focus on how the game put your back against a wall. Than you can elaborate your own strategy, but until then, enjoy the game as well as you want to. Really funny!</comment>

The base game has loads of replayability and is worth the rating on it's own ... and then they go and throw in all those extra maps thereby creating such diversity. Outstanding.</comment>

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">The fact that the game is so unforgiving makes this game really fun for me - you're deep in the red and you really need to huff it to make some dough by the end.

    <comment game="Age of Steam" game_id="4098" location="United States">Age of Steam is a wonderful game, and less intimidating than you might think. The game rewards careful math and long-term planning, but is very enjoyable to play even if you know you're not going to win. I hope to play many, many games of AoS in my lifetime.  In addition to the official/authorized expansion maps I own, I also have put together these internet releases:  Alpha Centauri - A New Hope: A fun 2-player map that doesn't deviate from the rules, but provides an interesting landscape on which to play. A great place to teach a new player the rules. Apparently this is the first in a series of Alpha Centauri maps that will throw in more special rules as each map comes out. A very cool idea.   Hong Kong: not played yet.  India: not played yet.  Japan: not played yet.  Northern England: not played yet.  Scotland: This is a very enjoyable 2-player map. It is tight, so don't get crazy with the locomotive. Urbanization can be very powerful here. I would like to try it using the Reunion Island locked action mechanism, but unfortunately I don't know how it works.  Spain: not played yet.</comment>

    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="United States">One of the best games around.  Each time I play it I'm glad I did.  Plays great with 4 players, and is tougher with 5 players.</comment>
    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="Canada">Extremely limited action game with an integral auction component and multiple (?) paths to victory.  The game lasts seven turns, with each turn consisting of an auction phase, where each player purchases one item, and then a limited action phase, where each player performs 2 actions- purchase more useful items and/or "show your work", whereby points and/or money is generated.  The auction phase is interactive and has very subtle strategies to it.  Do you choose an item you're not really interested in, hoping someone else is, and will then purchase themselves out of the auction, leaving less people to compete with you on the item(s) you really want?  Do you get into a bidding war on an item you don't really want in order to make someone else pay more for it?  The action phase, while non-interactive, provides difficult decisions as money is very tight, and there always several things you want to do (purchase).  Also, you have to balance present financial considerations versus future point value of your profession cards (works).  Because of the tight money situation, you will often find yourself showing a work, even though you know you can get more value for it if you held onto to it longer.  There are several options/ways to score and win this game, although I think that some methods are much more dominant than others.  You can acquire jesters, lots of profession cards, and some recruiting cards and then show all of your works towards the end of the game for maximum value.  You can obtain several builders, make alot of buildings and show works early and often to obtain the 3 bonus points for the best work each time.  You can acquire valuable prestige cards and have a mix of profession cards, and use bonus cards to increase their value.    I have finally seen the light with this game, it is an outstanding game for 3-5 players (haven't played 2-players yet), and although it can be somewhat scripted at times, it is a strategic masterpiece, that is deceptively deep.  Own the [boardgame=165358]Princess and Muse[/boardgame] mini-expansion from the [boardgame=40688]Treasure Chest[/boardgame] and a nice homemade version of the Builders expansion, and I find now that I'd rather always play with the expansion than without it.  It adds several new pathways to victory, despite adding a bit more length to the gameplay.</comment>
    <comment game="The Princes of Florence" game_id="555" location="England">Brilliant game and I've always found it interactive, watching out for what others are doing, and where the bidding is going. </comment>

But you still have to be flexible to pull it off.</comment>

    <comment game="The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game" game_id="77423" location="United States">After many, many plays of this game, I still find it to be an excellent game with lots of options and tough decisions to be made.  However, it has started to feel somewhat samey to me as my wife and I have done the same quests to death.  I'll continue to play the game, and I'm sure the first expansion pack will re-energize my interest, but right now I'm feeling tired of the game, thus I've downgraded my rating from a 9.5 to an 8.5.  UPDATE (11-6-13): The comments above were written 5-30-11, back when the game was brand new and a delay in the release of the first expansion caused the game to feel a bit played out.  I can say now, almost two and a half years later, that the game is and has been my second favorite game for quite some time.  It's simply a fantastic game system that has been constantly evolving and breaking new ground with each expansion.  There are so many expansions out now that I haven't even been able to play all of them, and the game has maintained a high level of quality with all of its releases that I've played.  I can see myself playing the game for many more years to come.</comment>

    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="">Go rivals chess for intensity and complexity. Go's rules are actually simpler than chess, but its very human-ness makes it a very difficult game to get a computer to play. Weak chess players find it miserable to play against someone better, but Go's handicap system makes it possible for weak and strong players to sit down to a game that challenges both. If you're looking for the challenges and camaraderie of something like a chess club but without the extreme stratification you find with chess, Go might be your game.</comment>

    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United Kingdom">The greatest and the simplest game in the world. I have just downgraded it ONLY because I don`t have the brainpower to play this amazing but long and very complicated game. Still the best game ever made though. STOP PRESS: I have upgraded it to 10 again because it really is the most sublime game ever. It deserves a 10.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">I don't play nearly as much as I want to or should, and I'm still deep in double-digit kyu, but this game is basically perfect.  Simple and elegant mechanics disguise an incredibly deep and thoughtful game.  Could easily keep you occupied for your entire life.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">THE game.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="Switzerland">recently discovered: incredible game. simple in learning diffiult to master. a piece in history of games. not for children or family games indeed, but... respect</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="">Straight-up: the oldest and most complicated game.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">Elegantly simple rules and components; astonishingly deep and varied play--over and over again.  This is one of few "lifetime" (or "desert island") games.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">Greatest. Board. Game. Ever.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="Canada">The best boardgame.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="">What can one say?  It's Go.  It's a perfect game, and I suck at it.  And yet, I am enchanted by it, and wish I played it more.  (I also believe that, like mathematics and music, it is something the aliens will understand whenever they show up.  So, you know, get good at Go and you can find common ground with the aliens.  That's always good.)</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">Ten points, strictly out of respect for the game's depth and aesthetics. I prefer chess.</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">No doubt: it is the best game in the entire universe.  I have reached a rank of approximately 1-2 Dan. (UPDATE: out of practice!) The highlight of my Go playing history: Beating a 6 Dan in an even game (though he wasn't trying very hard. :D )</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="Norway">Great combination of strategy and tactics, while a little lacking on the theme side..</comment>
    <comment game="Go" game_id="188" location="United States">Classic with transferable skills and lessons as vital today as ever.</comment>
    <comment game="Village" game_id="104006" location="United States">One of my favorite games. Very fair game play, regardless what strategy one focuses on. </comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="United States">121231 I do not like suicide Tichu anymore.  Not after learning this nifty passing convention.  I will not play Tichu without this convention any more.  Its a little convoluted but here it is.  If you draw one of the power6 cards (dragon, phoenix or aces) then pass it to your partner. If you draw two, keep them both and pass an even card (or Q) to your partner.  If you draw none, then pass an odd card (or J,K).   Makes for a great game!  111021 This is a game if I ever play in a group regularly that will become a classic.  A little getting used to if not used to climbing card games.  Otherwise, not that hard, but the partnership aspect really makes it a totally different beast.  A hell of a lot more stressful than 13.  Still its great,but needs a different mindset.  Several plays later, I still find the allowable sets annoying.  I like it cause everyone knows it, but I'd prefer to try some other climbing games before settling on this one.  110100 I really, really liked playing Suicide Tichu.  I might drop it if I like my Tichu/VC version more, but until I get it played, I'll take Suicide Tichu any day.  (Suicide Tichu, every hand one partner on each team must call Tichu or grand).    100100 But now I have decided that what I really, really, really like is playing mega agressive tichu with no care for ultimate winning.  Unfortunately this requires a partner who is willing to go along, but when it does, its a lovely game.</comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="Germany">Eines der besten Kartenspiele was ich kenne! Stichspiel, manchmal konfus, aber dadurch teilweise auch &#252;berraschend! Man muss schon strategisch spielen, aber ganz so ausrechenbar wie ein Skat oder Doppelkopf ist es zum Gl&#252;ck nicht. Man kann den gegner sehr gut &#252;berraschen! kaufen kaufen kaufen</comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="Belgium">Best card game I ever learned.</comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="United Kingdom">My favourite card game, assuming players who like this sort of game since the partnership is the key.  Often gets played as a filler when I teach it to new players but always happy to play this as the main event to the full 1,000 points. </comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="Poland">amazing.</comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="United States">Great partnership game.</comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="United States">Awesome!  Best partnership card game there is! </comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="Brazil">You have 4 guys to play? This is the best game of cards ever.</comment>
    <comment game="Tichu" game_id="215" location="Canada">*4 Players  This is a very exciting game.  It creates a lot of excitement in a small amount of time.  It may seems complicated at first but don't let this stop you.  Once you get the hang of it, you'll smile and start to understand why it is so high up in the rank.    So far, the best lunch time game I've played!</comment>
    <comment game="Jaipur" game_id="54043" location="United States">Probably my favorite on this list. Easy to learn, always interesting, and great for two.</comment>
    <comment game="Jaipur" game_id="54043" location="United States">Hands down, most played game in my collection.  I will play this every day and I do!</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Australia">Lots and lots of plays - just the best TTR version. It's a good move reprinting it. Terrific 2 and 3 player game. Not too long, and great tension. At the top of the list of the family's favourite games. Wife favourite.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Canada">Fantastic extension of the TTR series for 2-3 players.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United Kingdom">The best expansion - ideal for 2 or 3 players - and more opportunities to interfere with opponents plans</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">Perfect for two or three player games! Just unbox and play.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">2-3 players. Keep 2011.</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="Finland">An excellent game that works with two players, too!</comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United States">We enjoyed the original Ticket to Ride but since we were rarely able to play it with three or more players we felt like we were missing out. So we picked up a version designed specifically for 2-3 players and it is awesome. A bit more cutthroat than the original or Europe due to the board size and rail lines. We love this one. Plus the art is even better on this one thanks to the winter theme. </comment>
    <comment game="Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries" game_id="31627" location="United Kingdom">yes, I can be a junkie.  Seems just as strong as switzerland, which I like.  Mayube even better...</comment>
    <comment game="Imperial Settlers" game_id="154203" location="Romania">I actually feel that it is a 9.5 game, but I want to raise its ranking, since it is such a great game. </comment>
