    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="England">Three things: 1. I love Pandemic 2. I love Legacy games where the game state changes across plays 3. I'm not concerned that you can't play again once you've finished. So why have I rated this a 1? Because for me and my fellow player the game turned out to be broken. Three quaters of the way through a card was revealed that contains, with hindsight, ambiguous instructions. We followed these and ended up some plays later, in a terrible position. We were then presented with something new that made no sense so we checked the internet and discovered the card was intended to be read in another way. By this time we couldn't reasonably undo prior plays and there was no point continuing. So we abandoned it before the end with great disappointment. If we'd read the card the way it was intended I think it would have lead to an exciting conclusion. Very surprised this didn't come up in play testing, and we aren't the only ones this has happened to. So very disappointing for us. I've avoided going into any detail so as not to provide spoilers.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Dreadful, the absolute worst experience I've ever had with a game.  Three and a half hours of watching people stare aimlessly at a table while arranging pumpkins and small animals. I never want to hear anyone who likes this game complain about any other game causing AP. Lame theme, horrible pacing and simply way way to long.  I hope I never see this mess again.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">This appears to be one of those games you either love or hate.  I'm sorry, I'm probably swimming upstream, but in the 4-5 times I've played it, I have formed an extremely negative opinion of the game.  The Turn order always messes me up.  The guy in front of me invariably takes what will screw me over or what I need the most.  I just don't get the strategy or the appeal of the game.  You could not pay me to play it.  Then there are all of the "unofficial" expansions that people are printing out and tossing into the mix that makes it even worse.  After trying to play a few more times my opinion has not changed.. in fact, I hate it more than ever. </comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Played it just once. Couldn't get my opponents to finish the game; it was a struggle from beginning to end trying to keep them interested. Needless to say, I will never play it again. Game is waaaaaay over-rated.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">This is a broken game. You win this game every time if you get all your players into the Ragnar&#246;k and lose the most battles. Winning battles is the worst thing you could do as a Viking Warrior apparently... The theme of the game does not work at all with the mechanics and scoring. I would think that the winner would be the last one standing, but what would I know.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">I played this once, and I won it, so don't call me a sore loser when I say this sucks.  If it were fun, it wouldn't suck, but it lacks fun.  It lacks theme.  It's so un-fun that it's a black hole sucking the joy out of everything around it.  If you are the next table over from a group playing Brass, your game isn't going to be as fun.  Just pick up your game and move.   If you think this is "fun," you probably think Mr. Spock is a wild and crazy guy!  But you know what would make this game fun?  Dinosaurs.  If they were carrying laser guns and flying space ships, this game would be incredible.  But you see, dinosaurs do those kind of things.  Unfortunately, this game has no dinosaurs.  Maybe an expansion will take care of that deficiency.  One can only hope.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="">Played it quite a few times and never could figure out how to get a decent score, even following suggestions posted on BGG. This game is ANNOYING!</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="">With a traitor = 5, without a traitor = 1. Nothing exceptional or unique here, a super-busy mashup of a cooperative intrigue game, tries to achieve too much and results in lots of down time. I hate the theme and the role playing aspects which are exceptionally nerdy.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Indonesia">Its 2016 not 80's, do the artwork, with a plain paper a pen and a ruler even a grade6 can do that kind of artwork. Please hire an artist,there are a lot of them in the world. You allready charge way too high for the game, it won't hurt to hire an artist. Still thinking hire an artist cost too much,go to 3rd world country there are a lot of them come in cheap price.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">Like a loooong slog through thigh deep mud, only to arrive just as someone beats you to it. Which wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take several turns to set up for every move. Then you can try something else if you have the correct resources, or go on with your plan if you have the money to pay double. Cards cannot be counted on as by the time your turn rolls around it may be a completely new set and not ones you can afford or even use. Locations may favor the start players and that may or may not be mitigated by the "double prizes" for the last player. Almost no way to plan ahead. Given the random board setup and rotating cards, I would argue there is luck involved. Luck in turn order vs. board lay out and how the cards come out. Played 2 games, one 4 player and one 5 player. Won one, lost one. I don't hate Euros by any stretch, but you could not pay me to play this one again! Pure torture.   Sold at JVMA - making lemonade...</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United States">Even though Star Wars is the stoopidest story ever told....  I thought this game might be interesting....but it's not.  I think it only works if you're dumb enough to think Star Wars is cool.   I'm not looking for realism in cardboard, but there's just no way this is representative of even the fairy tale physics of Star Wars combat.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Canada">It does okay at capturing the feel of the early re-imagined series, but game play is dreadful. Too much time between turns, too many random elements that can leave a player with nothing meaningful to do. The admiral gets to make far too many decisions and the other players are bored to tears.  This is the only game I have played that if it were to hit the table again I would leave; just thinking about it elicits such incredible revulsion.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">I was enjoying this game, then it UNDESERVINGLY stole Twilight Struggle's throne with 1/6 of the votes (and a deliberate sabotage campaign)...  and then September happened. So in pure spite of Pandemic Legacy getting to #1, let me just say...  &#729;&#623;&#477;&#613;&#647; &#477;&#387;&#592;&#647;oq&#592;s o&#647; &#623;&#592;&#477;&#647; &#633;&#7433;&#477;&#613;&#647; uo &#633;o&#647;&#7433;&#592;&#633;&#647; &#592; p&#477;&#647;u&#592;ld pu&#592; '&#647;&#592;o&#387;&#477;d&#592;&#596;s &#596;&#7433;lqnd &#592; s&#592; &#390;p&#390; &#477;&#613;&#647; &#387;u&#7433;sn &#477;&#633;&#592; pu&#592; s&#477;&#7433;q&#623;oz p&#477;p&#592;&#607; &#592;po&#596; &#477;&#613;&#647; p&#477;&#633;&#477;&#477;u&#7433;&#387;u&#477;-o&#7433;q &#654;&#633;&#592;&#647;&#7433;l&#7433;&#623; &#477;&#613;&#9524;  Oh, did I forget to put "spoiler" in front of that? Silly me.   Maybe I'm also pissed that this game screwed us over completely in our campaign (see below). And a co-op as #1 means that inferior games will now get all the attention, as if there wasn't already a critical mass of dilettantes in the hobby who only want to play Catan, Ticket to Ride, and maybe Lords of Waterdeep if you're "lucky."    Oh, and we predicted the Big Twist way back in the May campaign game, so it was pretty lame that it wasn't more creative.   But the reason I got so pissed and decided to spoil it is because our game is now BASICALLY UNWINNABLE:    &#729;s&#7433; &#647;&#7433; s&#592; uo &#387;u&#592;&#613; o&#647; &#477;lq&#592; u&#477;&#477;q &#654;l&#477;&#633;&#592;q &#477;&#652;&#592;&#613; o&#613;&#653; s&#633;&#477;&#647;&#596;&#592;&#633;&#592;&#613;&#596; &#670;s&#7433;&#633; o&#647; s&#7433; &#647;u&#477;&#623;&#647;&#592;&#477;&#633;&#647; p&#477;p&#592;&#607; &#592; &#9524;&#398;&#1508; o&#647; &#654;&#592;&#653; &#654;luo &#477;&#613;&#647; oS &#729;&#633;&#592;&#596;s &#477;uo s&#592;&#613; &#654;p&#592;&#477;&#633;l&#592; &#647;s&#7433;l&#592;&#7433;&#596;&#477;dS &#477;u&#7433;&#647;u&#592;&#633;&#592;nQ &#477;&#613;&#647; pu&#592; '&#477;uoz &#8704;po&#390; &#477;&#613;&#647; o&#647;u&#7433; oq&#623;o&#596; &#647;s&#7433;&#647;u&#477;&#7433;&#596;S/&#633;&#477;&#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;s&#477;&#633; &#633;no &#387;u&#7433;pu&#477;s &#477;&#653; &#633;no ll&#477;&#613; u&#7433; &#654;&#592;&#653; oN &#729;&#654;l&#647;u&#477;&#7433;&#596;&#7433;&#607;&#607;&#477; &#477;uop &#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;S &#477;&#613;&#647; &#647;&#477;&#387; plno&#596; &#477;&#653; os llnd-&#477;&#633; o&#647; &#633;&#477;&#7433;ploS &#477;&#613;&#647; &#633;o&#607; sp&#633;&#592;&#596; p&#477;dd&#7433;nb&#477; &#654;ll&#592;&#596;&#7433;&#607;&#7433;&#596;&#477;ds p&#592;&#613; &#477;&#653; pN&#8704; 'snuoq &#654;&#633;&#592;&#647;&#7433;l&#7433;&#623; &#406;+ &#477;&#613;&#647; &#387;u&#7433;sol &#477;&#633;,&#477;&#653; &#477;&#596;u&#7433;s '&#477;&#633;o&#623;&#654;u&#592; &#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;S &#477;&#647;&#477;ld&#623;o&#596; o&#647; &#654;&#592;&#653; poo&#387; ou s,&#477;&#633;&#477;&#613;&#9524; -   &#729;&#647;&#7433; &#647;n&#596; o&#647; &#387;u&#7433;o&#387; &#647;,us&#7433; &#647;&#7433; &#647;nq &#477;&#623;&#592;&#387; &#647;s&#592;l &#633;no u&#7433; s&#477;&#7433;&#647;&#7433;&#596; u&#477;ll&#592;&#607;/&#387;u&#7433;sd&#592;llo&#596; &#4357; &#477;&#613;&#647; puno&#633;&#592; dn s&#670;&#596;olqp&#592;o&#633; &#647;u&#477;u&#592;&#623;&#633;&#477;d &#477;&#623;os &#647;o&#387; &#477;M &#729;&#613;&#647;uo&#623; &#647;x&#477;u &#477;sd&#592;llo&#596; o&#647; &#387;u&#7433;o&#387; s&#7433; &#592;&#7433;s&#8704; '&#477;&#623;&#7433;&#647; &#592; &#647;&#592; &#406; &#387;u&#7433;llnd l&#477;uolo&#390; &#477;&#613;&#647; u&#592;&#613;&#647; &#633;&#477;&#613;&#647;o p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; &#647;&#592;&#477;&#633;&#647; o&#647; &#654;&#647;&#7433;l&#7433;q&#592; ou &#613;&#647;&#7433;M -   &#729;&#633;&#477;&#647;&#596;&#592;&#633;&#592;&#613;&#390; &#647;so&#741; &#592; &#653;ou s&#7433; &#1508;NINNIM &#8516;&#741;&#398;&#633;&#8704;q sn &#647;d&#477;&#670; &#647;&#592;&#613;&#647; &#387;u&#7433;&#613;&#647; &#654;luo &#477;&#613;&#647; os '&#398;NO&#1508; S,&#9524;&#8704;H&#9524; 'll&#477;M &#729;s&#477;sn &#477;ld&#7433;&#647;ln&#623; &#387;u&#7433;&#647;&#647;&#477;&#387; 's&#647;u&#477;&#652;&#477; llnd-&#477;&#633; o&#647; &#647;s&#7433;l&#592;&#7433;&#596;&#477;dS &#477;u&#7433;&#647;u&#592;&#633;&#592;nQ &#613;&#647;&#7433;&#653; &#654;&#387;&#633;&#477;u&#654;s &#592; p&#592;&#613; &#477;&#613; pu&#8704; &#729;(dn&#647;&#477;s &#647;&#592; &#477;uoz p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; &#477;&#613;&#647; u&#7433; s,&#400; &#477;lqnop &#607;o &#647;ol &#592; p&#592;&#613; &#477;&#652;,&#477;&#653;) p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; u&#7433;&#592;&#647;uo&#596; &#654;ll&#592;n&#647;&#596;&#592; pu&#592; 's&#477;&#613;&#596;&#633;&#592;&#477;S &#477;&#647;&#477;ld&#623;o&#596; &#654;l&#647;u&#477;&#7433;&#596;&#7433;&#607;&#607;&#477; '&#647;u&#477;&#623;d&#7433;nb&#398; llnd plno&#596; 's&#633;&#592;&#596;s p&#477;p&#592;&#8498; o&#647; &#477;un&#623;&#623;&#7433; s&#592;&#653; o&#613;&#653; &#477;uo &#477;&#613;&#647; s&#592;&#653; &#477;H &#729;&#633;&#477;&#7433;ploS &#477;&#613;&#647; s&#592;&#653; &#633;o&#647;&#7433;&#592;&#633;&#647; &#633;nO -  And there's up to 6 more games of this left. Dropped my rating to a 2 in a fit of rage. Screw you, Pandemic Legacy. And I'm not too fond of your booster club, either. </comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="Canada">I am fine with the limited playability. But its just boring. Lots of luck. Not enough strategy for what I like. Not a lot of Oh damn I can't believe that just happened! Which is what I was hoping for. </comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">I understand and appreciate that a lot of time and energy went into the design, there are just some aspects of the game that are crippling *to me*. I find that the critical nature of my decisions are decreasing as the game wears on to the point that after the first round is over, I'm already past the half-way point on that decline. What faction you pick, and where you start your settlements will have a bigger effect on your success rate than any other factor in our experience (related to how likely it is that someone can effectively steal a spot from you, how effectively you can expand and exploit your faction's specialty, etc). This goes hand in hand with the static setup of the board, so the variable powers have favored setup locations and strategy already defined for them during that critical decision making period. As such, there are only a few spots that are of particular value for each faction, and outside of that, it's not worth it. So the net effect here is that all of my super important choices occur before the first turn, and as the game progresses, each choice I make is less likely to create any serious swing or effect on the end game, to the point where the final 2 rounds are largely auto-pilot in terms of game play.  Second, I find that I have 8 or 10 choices each turn, but really only 1 or 2 of those will do anything other than cause a backslide (similar to the opening setup choices), so I don't spend my time debating choices so much as taking the obvious choice and planning multiple turns of obvious choices in advance. It's a very tight game in that regard where the potential to "catch up" or make breakthroughs to put pressure on opponents in the second half of the game just doesn't exist. I like wide choices where no one choice sinks you and they are largely opportunistic in their timing and accordance with your strategy. Terra Mystica seems to favor a "deep" approach where you don't have as many choices, but you plan for multiple turns in concert.   Last, it takes about four times as long to play a 4p game as I'm realistically interested in investing in said design. A large reason for this is that the late game decisions are all sort of meh. I actually enjoy the game when I can bang out a session online on lodev in 30 minutes.  It's not a bad game, it's just not a game for me. My 7 plays in person (3-4p) and 10+ on lodev have helped me learn my preferences in games, so it's not time wasted, but I won't play it again.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Germany">While the mechanics are nice, there is just not enough pressure as in Agricola and the replayability is a lot lower, too. In addition, you do too much per action, diminishing the importance of certain actions.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">The art in this game was nice, though the theme was lacking. My husband and I were bored with this one. We did give it a few tries though.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Norway">I find this dry, asocial and downright dull. One of few games I'd rather sit out on than play. I know many hold this game in high regard, and I've played it eight times to give it a fair change. But it is clearly not for me. This just doesn't have any of the ingredients I enjoy in a game and I honestly don't see what others like about it.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United Kingdom">The Coldplay of modern boardgaming. Fucking boring and inexplicably successful.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">I played this game once. After the first of 3 rounds, I honestly thought we had the rules incorrect, as the game was so bad that I was certain that we had missed something.  The only reason this game is rated so well is because of the miniatures. This is the worst game I have ever played within the strategy genre.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">120102 ok game, I'm not sure what makes it so awesome, but maybe I'll catch on later.  I think I just don't like games that have too many mechanisms going on at once -- everything starts to just feel tacked on.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Vote for pure hatred of all things LCG / CCG. And because its top ten ranking is a ridiculous fanboy byproduct... I will never understand how this, Mage Knight, or Eclipse are top 10. The other seven games, I can see why people would rank them highly (and I only like half of them at best). And even Eclipse and Mage Knight, I can almost see it in that fuzzy magic-eye puzzle sort of way, if I turn my head upside-down and squint really hard. Are people just ranking it based on how much money game stores are making off of it? </comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Australia">Just too much bookkeeping and rules knowledge for me to really enjoy.   I'm happy to learn a system, but this game is all about learning the system, without much actual gaming taking place. </comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Canada">Broken Broken Broken. I gave a 2 because it's fun to move the gears.  Why is it broken? I'm surprised you ask. You must not have played a lot with the experts..... What is a broken game? A broken game is a game when ONE AND ONE ONLY AND ALWAYS THE SAME ONE strategy leads to victory. Meaning, if you pursue any other strategy, no matter how good you pursue it and how clever you are, the noob doing the ONE WINNING strategy will outflank you eyes wide shut.  In Tzolk'in case, this strategy is get to 6 workers very fast. Don't feed them by converting wheat to resources. Row 2 level III tech as fast as you can. Pile up, pile up, pile up, pile up like there is no tomorrow. On cycle 4, reap everything, build everything, climb everywhere. and you win with a 200+ score. That's why you don't see any players now doing the skull strategy.  Don't listen to experts who tell you this strategy is counterable. It is not. Unless by the same strategy which proves it is broken. On the contrary, Puerto Rico is not a broken game.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Germany">Almost not a game. Never again. </comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Argentina">Why is this game ranked so high? Why the praise? It's just a poor man's Fighting Fantasy book....well, I should've said rich man. Gamebooks are really old, and putting the paragraphs on cards doesn't make something revolutionary. You can buy a FF gamebook for $1. You can find better challenges and puzzles there (House of Hell and Creature of Havoc, for instance), and please remember, you have 400 paragraphs in a FF book. T.I.M.E Stories is FOUR times shorter and FIFTY times more expensive. Ridiculous! And to add insult to injury, cards are wasted in the intro and items you find. A joke. Zero replayability, zero innovation. And the first two themes, used in Asylum and Marcy Case, are pathetic and overused. I expected a crime scene, interrogations and a culprit. I expected a good story, not this. The extra point I give this game is for the art.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Words cannot describe -- I tried Dead of Winter and disliked it a lot. I won't be trying it again -- this isn't my type of game.  First of all, there's no semblance of a struggle to survive in this game. We had to just 'stay alive' for five rounds, but everything we had to do seemed obvious. We weren't over-run by zombies at any point, we fended them off easily, and there was nothing to do except that. Perhaps we tried a bad scenario, but even so, the basic mechanics of the game seemed really...boring.  I dislike zombies in general, and this is a game that would have profited without them. Set this on a desert island, add in some sort of sun beats down mechanic (kind of like Forbidden Desert), and make the zombies wild beasts. You've instantly got a better game just because the survival aspect matches the theme a lot better. The game still would need mechanical tweaks, but the zombie theme was just a huge turnoff overall to me.  I'll try anything at least once, but some games don't need much more for me to dislike them.  Not recommended. Check out [thing=15062][/thing] for a more successful take on the semi-co-op.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">Tons of bits, but random set up can make or break a game. If the game was a 20 minute affair, the random set-up would be acceptable. for a four to six, even eight hour game, it is ridiculous. And if you [b]do[/b] have a fair tile distribution, then the game will be longer -- not a very practical affair.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">120102 meh.  I just don't like worker placement mechanisms combined with too much other stuff.   That's why caylus works for me, but these layter more complicated ones do not.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="">Another game that is STRICTLY WORSE as a boardgame as opposed to being a PC game.  + Yay dice.   - We secretly roll dice and secretly assign them, behind a screen. What?! This is the greatest invitation to cheating i have ever seen in any game.  "Don't play with cheaters." Don't design games to have glaring holes that can be exploited at any moment by anyone without any consequences.  - Zero interaction. Literally. Zero. Interaction. The game has four hundred components and they manage to put ZERO interaction in. Invade others' planets. Work together on some developments. Trade goods. Kill their workforce, fight with ships, bribe, bluff, negotiate... Nope. None of it. The game BEGS to be interactive and they manage to destroy all traces of life in it. Shut up, sit down, stare at your part of the game, collect points, go home.  Singleplayer multiplayer boardgames are the worst.  - There's no reason to play this live. You gain NOTHING from playing live that you couldn't gain online. That's a mark of a miserable game. It is only more fiddly, clunky, chaotic, slow.   - A bunch of rules that flavorfully make no sense. The kind you put in to make the game flow exactly as planned, with no regard to flavor. Another classic example of good game design.  2.5/10 Enjoy your spot in the top 100, Roll. You're everything that most BGG raters want.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">Very beautiful and I can see how others may like it, but I want to burn this game with fire.  There is way too much open information to be able to actively consider on a turn.  There is often a best move that can be taken by a player.  It then becomes a where's waldo game of trying to find the best move.  It's difficult to plan on your turn as the board state changes between players.  Wanted to quit half way through (even though I ended up winning).  Will not play this again.</comment>

There are so many Rules its hard keep them in mind at the beginning. The missing german rulebook supported the heaviness. Nations feels way smoother than this monster although it might be a really good game if everyone is familiar with it. Not quite sure if the way, to get to this point, is maybe too long.  </comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">I thought for sure another play of this game would increase my rating but I was wrong. This game is too confusing at the surface level for the simplicity of the mechanics underneath. It felt too tactic-ish and not enough strategy-ish. </comment>

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">A lot of choices and strategy here, which is usually a good thing. Unfortunately, I find theme thin and uninteresting and some the mechanics needlessly obtuse and arbitrary. I guess you have to play it several times before you "get" the strategy, but there wasn't much there to interest me. If the strategy isn't intuitive or if I can't figure out what to do after a game, there has to be *something* inherently fun or interesting about the game for me to want to play it again. It's not inherently fun or interesting to me though. Maybe it was partly because of the theme, but I found Ingenious and Qwirkle more engaging and interesting that this game so it wasn't just the dry theme.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">I enjoy it, but only at 2 and *maybe* 3p. Something about the downtime of 4p and the shift in strategy to heavy warehousing/shipping sort of sucks to me (but it doesn't bother me that strategy shifts in other games). At 2p, I find the game doesn't overstay it's welcome for being multiplayer solitaire combo chaining game. One of my largest complaints is that the downtime between turns as you add players, combined with the inability to make solid plans more than 2 plays in advance really hurts. Last, nothing really stands out about the game and makes me go "oh, I want to play this more."</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Australia">No matter how coherent, a game can be too long.   I prefer the abstraction of Innovation and Settler for civilization games as board games.

There's just too much fiddliness here for the luck. </comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">130929 The fact this game grinds to a halt at the last couple turns means I will avoid playing this game...maybe one more time with a different group just to make sure it wasn't a Houston groupthink issue.  110604 I've really come to hate the last couple turns of the game.  And it really doesn't work 2P.  I think there is a good 2P game there, but I haven't found it yet.  The game is not nearly as heavy as its reputation that seemed to had taken hold in my head.  I really like it and I have to admit the artwork is a big reason.  I really like the cartoony nature of it =).  The game moved pretty briskly (I was the only noob) and its an interesting exercise in math on the fly.  Last couple turns kinda drag though.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Norway">I find the first half of the game a bit boring since there usually won't be any player interaction until late in the game. Also, the combat system seems flawed. The worst offender is a particular weapon so extremely powerful and useful that whoever gets it usually easily win. I like the theme and uncomplicated gameplay, but all in all it is not for me. I own the ipad version.  Edit: I have played it some more and now like it even less. Now it alternates between boring and downright annoying. I'm quite certain I won't play this again.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">Looks like a Euro; priced like a Euro; but it's nothing but Ameritrash: tactical, with lots of bits and fiddling and randomness, but no real tension or decision making involved. The iOS implementation faithfully, meticulously, and attractively captures every one of these attributes &#8212; and gets the same rating.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="">Rating is probationary; the design is slick in a lot of ways, and easy to learn, and flows, and there are numerous things to do.  The problem is that it feels like a "civ" game but your civ is too simple.  Entering the arena with Through the Ages is dangerous; the reduced play time buys some slack, but not enough slack to cover how boring parts of this seem so far.  Or, "needs some cards."  Not to increase the luck (there's plenty of that) but to add variation beyond which resources show up (which governs your economic development too much).  Ok, it's deadly dull.  Deadly.  Dull.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Australia">Early positive impressions faded fast.   The reality is the game is a bit too much the same from scenario-to-scenario. Good players will simply work out what needs to be done and only bad luck will stop them from doing it. The events have a lot of flavour, but they don't really change how you play, just make things easier or harder.   Still, serious gamers might not be it's core audience. If they are, it's a noble failure - if not, it's a disposable frolic.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">The more I play this the less I like it.  The theme is starting to bug me (so ... am I the mayor of Le Havre?  Who the hell is my work crew and why do they only work for food?  Why are all these cattle just sitting on the dock and why aren't they eating all of the grain right next to them?), and the dominance of the build-steel-ship-steel strategy is making for less and less interesting games without a lot of room to maneuver.  I wish the special buildings were goofier.</comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">151117 Its stayd on but I still don't play it.

I expect my rating to rise if I play more. Only bad thing - it takes ages to play - for 5 of us it went on over 3 hours.  Too long for me.  Update: I think I just don't enjoy heavy euros.

Seems fiddly, messy, random and just plain too long. Definitely has tons of cool theme and looks pretty good, though.  ---  Tried it, but actually hope I hadn't. It confirmed (or even exceeded) all the doubts I had.  Awful, awful game, borderline broken. Long, tedious, random and boring. Ridiculous components, fiddly and messy gameplay - "do this to do that to get what you actually wanted to do done about three turns (and hours) later.. or maybe not at all."   It looks like it wants to be coolest game of all time, but actually could not be further from it. I do like civilization and empire building games, but this is not really one, despite appearances.. It's actually hard to say what it in fact is, except utter waste of time and money.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">A pet peeve of mine is games in which you can't plan.  Welcome to my own version of hell.  Every turn, after each player takes his or her turn, you are faced with a new board. There are random elements that are not significant but can influence the game play, and the game may simply disallow certain options by virtue of the random nature of the board.  If you are good at (or enjoy) managing random turns of events, this game will appeal to you. If herding cats sounds like a thankless task, well, move along then.</comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">1st play:  Every once in a while a game comes along that is hyped up, and when I play it, I have to assume I played a different game than everyone else.  This game forces you to stare at an iPad for 2 hours to essentially play Elder Signs.  There's no interesting decisions really, and the story isn't that great if Cthulu isn't your thing.  I'm not even sure there was a story now that I think about it....</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="">This game has a lot of potential but I'd recommend not buying into the hype and waiting at least until there are more scenarios for it. The "60-90min" intro scenario takes 3 hours with a full party and the other scenarios are all said to be longer. Unfortunately a lot of that 3 hours is down time. Unlike Descent's Road to Legend where there's a single peril effect, in this each player has to make a separate horror check which makes the sort of pointless random part of the game take A LOT longer.  P.S. The mini's are not good quality. P.P.S. I hate you Agent Carver.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="">Shuffling: the Game.  When a game is STRICTLY worse played live as opposed to online you have to ask yourself how and why on earth did it get made into a boardgame in the first place.  Live it takes 30-40 minutes. Online 5-10. That is 10 minutes of gameplay in 30+ minutes... The rest is shuffling, waiting for your turn, fiddling with cards, counting everything that could and should be done by a computer, not you.  There are countless opportunities to make an error live. You don't know how many cards are left in each stack, in your deck, your opponents'... which is basic and vital information.  There's so much downtime. Due to poor design a third of the game is spent just buying victory points. And worst of all, there's no interaction!  It's okay as an app on your phone. It's miserable as a boardgame.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="">Design philosophy behind Dominion: take a cool new idea and bury it in a game that panders to the lowest common denominator among Eurogamers. Sell lots of units.  When did Eurogames become synonymous with drafting? Oh, yeah, Puerto Rico.  Anyway, beat to the punch by FFG's StarCraft. So it didn't even have newness going for it.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States"> 1st plays: This is a much better version of Pandemic than the original, because the little decisions that you can ignore in pursuit of the greater victory suddenly become meaningful.  I rate the normal Pandemic at a 5 or a 6, and this game is better.  So far though, the game hasn't lived up to the hype - it's interesting but not even close to the best game ever.  2nd play: The game continues to heat up with new objectives, additional player powers and a brutal infection deck.  It's still Pandemic though.  It probably replaces base pandemic for me, and I'm happy to play it, but it ends up being just ok.  I don't understand all the love it's getting, but maybe when we get to May or June I'll come to understand.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="Brazil">Exactly like Pandemic, but in a "Tutorial-learn-as-you-play" way of getting you to play the last (and theoretically the most difficult) mission. I don't like pandemic "bad draws = easy lose" way of being, and Legacy is mostly the same in that matter.  And worse. If you play twice and decide you don't like the game, you can't even sell it. That sucks.</comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">I played a bit of this against AI and then most of a PBEM game that got killed due to one or two morons who wouldn't take their turns. I just can't bring myself to care. It's a "do this to do that" kind of game and I'm less and less interested in those types of things these days. I guess I don't like modern eruos much if this is what they look like. It basically feels like the boring, processional build orders of a computer RTS. Somehow this takes the timing and logistics that thrill me in something like 18xx and turns them into a dull chore. It's probably the modern euro point salad sensibility of weighing various decent options rather than arriving at a devious "aha!" moment.  It's like a Rube Goldberg machine that ends with a wet fart.</comment>

More exciting but less enjoyable. I've read that a lot of people just like the aspect of building their own farm.  I don't feel like that myself, but maybe that is me being competitive.  I find the victory points have to be considered, which puts a lot of pressure on in terms of: food, fences, family members, animals, vegetables, house construction. Theres a lot to the game and I find it pretty overwhelming.  Hopefully it will get easier. Update: Played for the 3rd time, this time with cards.  I've got to say I just don't enjoy this game. I came 2nd on a 5 player game so I've mostly 'got it' now, but I think I find having too much choice a bit too stressful and I'm too competitive to just enjoy building my own farm. Downgraded to a 5.  Update: I think I just don't enjoy heavy euros. Where is the fun? Downgraded to a 4.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">I'm not really sure why this game keeps getting listed at the top of the BGG charts. There is a steep learning curve, and once you are over that, there may be a span of 20 to 30 plays where you are somewhat excited, but it really gets "samey" for win conditions fast. Even with the "secret" objectives that randomize, there's an easy algorithm to winning each match, that you can spot right away. I feel like this is more of a "randomize the puzzle, figure out the code, put game away". For a lot of learning, setup and hassle, I'd rather play several other games that have a deeper theme, better mechanics, and are frankly more fun.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">130929  Yeah its just too long.  I don't think I will ever play this again.  Pax has everything I want in a game of this type.  And its more thematic to boot.  I just hate the fact that you need to know the deck to play TTR well.  121231 I learned this one day and then Pax Porfiana the next.  I wasn't really that taken with TTA anyways, but Pax just killed it.  I see why TTA is regarded so highly, its a very nice design (albeit physically slightly fiddly).  But not a game I enjoy playing.  If/when I procure a copy of Pax I'd most likely drop this game to a 2 rating.  Aside from personal preference critique, I have to say that I do not like the enclosed playing space of TTA.  All the age cards show up and that creates a closed ecosystem which makes for predictable game playing for those who enjoying honing their skill.  However, I much prefer the partial deck usage of Pax.  It creates an open game history which feels truly thematic.  That said, it is a nice implementation of Sid Meier's Civilization without a map.  I can't imagine that the actually branded Sid Meier Civilization is nearly this good (only read the rules to that game)</comment>

Couple that with lots of fiddly rules and multiple aspects to keep track of with no real rhyme or reason, and you end up being one of the most dissapointing games I've played in awhile. I want to like this game, but its like the really cool looking bottle of wine or beer with a cool label, yet tastes terrible and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  What I did like: the maps and minis.   Everything else in this game either requires learning too many rules that aren't intuitive or waiting through significant scenarios for meager rewards. It's not as deep as the Star Wars RPG's I grew up playing, and it's not as fun as battling with the Star Wars minis. I'm sure i'm in the minority, based on the BGG rating, but this game just isn't what I thought it could be, and wasn't all that fun.</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Austria">I'm a little confused by the amount of popularity that this game has. I will give it credit for having made something new out of a really simple concept, but on the other hand I don't really see what all the fuss is about.  I think it's an enjoyable mental exercise, but this game is not crazy, it's not loud, it's not funny... I don't really see how it would work in a party atmosphere.   I like the fact that Codenames is a cooperative game. It kinda reminds me of Mysterium, which is a game I really like, and yet, since there are words instead of pictures, usually the guessing part is pretty straight-forward and not as fun. That wouldn't be so bad actually though, if it wasn't for the fact that this game has A LOT of downtime. You sit there watching people thinking to come up with a clue and then listen to other people thinking out loud about what that clue could mean. Then finally it's your turn and you do the exact same thing.   So I don't particularly enjoy Codenames and I really can't see how this could work in a party-like situation. Apparently I just don't see in this box what many other people see. For me it's boring and really too slow and long for what it is.</comment>

And yes I'd play Agricola over Le Havre solely due to theme.  They are both great games, but not for me.  120909 Just not my type of game.

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Spain">So many things wrong with this title that I don't know where to start.  The game promises a lot, and then doesn't deliver. First game we finished thinking, wow, that can be a blast. Let see the next case, as if they fixed the wrong things can be a real unique game. And then, all went wrong.  No real decisions: Let's say that if the game was a "choose your adventure book", in page 1 would say "Go to page 2". And in page 2 , would say "Go to page 3", and so on. Seems that you do something, but you don't.  No story: If you want to give me a good story. Please, give me enough background, no just small bits that amount to nothing. Go there do that because I say so, is not really a nice plot.  Not enough explanations on rulebook. I know, you wanted to create a system, so let's put things open to fit anything we throw them later. But really? A game with only 2 realy choices (explore (test/move/do nothing)- change location) should be 100% explained.  Too much imprecisions in the cards. Ok, that isn't easy. I guess not enough playtest was on the cases. Some weird ways to do the things, without any explanation.  The system doesn't really works, unless more work is put on the cases. The third run is a mash-up of what you do on first and second ones (but now in the right order, but you are almost not discovering anything). If you by chance need a fourth one, I really pity you. One hour lost repeating things you already now.  If this comment seems resentful, it is. The game seems for moments to find the good ways to present info and deliver an story. And it has some really nice touches. But that's all. Nothing else. And for some moments seems that they didn't playtest some parts.   </comment>

    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="Finland">I have found the genre of theme heavy, co-operative survival games to be one of the most (if not the most) difficult genres to make. Having played a number of them, I have come to a conclusion that most are horrible while only a few are actually good ones. Dead of Winter falls into the category of horrible.   My biggest complaint is about the down time. At the very beginning it is still ok, but once new characters start entering the game it all freezes dead. There are just too many moving pieces on the board and all cohesion is lost. To add to the horror of waiting, an event card is drawn at the beginning of every turn. Ok, this a common mechanic but the cards in Dead of Winter have way too much flavour text. When you have patiently waited for your turn for 10 minutes, you do not want to have the game stop for another 1-2 minutes turn.   It is a fine balance between keeping the game playable and adding &#8220;thematic&#8221; stuff that is supposed to help with the immersion. Easily this extra fluff is not meaningful from the mechanical point of view and does not actually add to the dramatic arc either, but only gives you random and unrelated events.   I am still waiting for the grail in this category of games, i.e., dripping with theme and stories while everything propels the game and the story forward. As of this writing, Arkham Horror is the closest to a grail so far. At least there the down time is not so much of an issue.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="Austria">I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  Another roll and draw American game. I can see why a lot of people may like it, but it's really not my cup of tea. On the plus side I really appreciate that the dice rolling is not crucial on what you can do in your turn, but it also felt underwhelming to me... almost pasted on the game, just to appeal to dice enthusiasts. The realization of the scenario and crisis mechanisms was furthermore poor to me, as it has been done just to give opportunities to the traitor, but they didn't stand on their own. The biggest let down though for me was the concept of the Crossroads cards. What's so innovative about that? It's almost exactly the same idea that Arkham Horror has and it's exactly one of the reasons why I don't like that game. I even thought that I would have liked it better here, because the player couldn't tell when the event would have triggered. Then I discovered that the triggers are so generic, that the event takes place almost every time... making the entire thing almost meaningless.  So again, maybe it's just not my cup of tea. It's another game that it's just all theme and no mechanics. I really don't understand where is the fun in the whole "draw and see what happens" system. I play boardgames to have a challenge and some decisions to make and, if what I want instead is a story, I would much rather play an RPG.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="">The game reminds me of one of those early Abercrombie fantasy books. Nice idea, beautiful story, but throw away half of the overflowing content and nobody would really notice. In fact, the game/book would have been much better without it.   I like the overall idea of having different kinds of workers to place on interesting actions, the road network for addition perks is nice, but what do I need this extra court for? I mean, I see the idea, getting rid of useless workers for some extra bonus, but its just ... too ... much for one game.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">1st play: Smooth well designed euro but without much to make it stand out. The elements of the game were all things I've seen before in other games, and they were packaged together in a pleasant way. That said, there wasn't anything that draws me back to wanting to play again. The player powers were interesting but because they were so strong, it essentially forced me down a particular path. Additionally, the game doesn't build from round to round, so the actions you take in the 5th round are the same as the first round, and there's no real end game.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Colombia">Ugh. How could a dice placement game be so boring? I've found the most optimal way to play this is just get contracts and fulfil them, totally ignoring all the other seemingly cool parts of the game, like travelling or getting special powers.  This one is a pass from me. If someone really wants to play it, I might sit down to it again, but it's not something I'm looking forward to.</comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">Concordia may have dispensed with the rondel, yet it has Mac Gerdts' signature all over it. There are still the single action player turns thanks to action cards.  Concordia is also a well-developed game with no sharp edges or clunky mechanisms.  Like Navegador it feels a highly abstracted design that happens to be played out on a map.    The innovation this time is handbuilding, picking up cards from a face-up row of reducing cost.  Cards all feature actions, but also a God affiliation that provides a multiplier for vps related to various things.  Concordia feels rather slow to get going - building up from almost nothing in incremental steps - and very slow to end.  It's not helped by a feeling of same old, same old collecting resources and converting them into victory points.  There is nothing exceptional about the artwork, but it is fairly pleasing to the eye.  Production quality is good.    </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">3 plays...I now feel no inclinaiton to play the game again, without some significant house rule changes.  However, I do feel a desire to try and fix it, into something that I will find playable.  The rest of my comments relates to the 'unpatched' version of the game. :)    The role selection system looks like Puerto Rico's, but really, the first guy needs to choose imperial and the second needs initiative to get imperial, or else you just cant get to 10 points faster than the other guys (if you arent doing this, you fall hopelessly behind). ..After that, technology is almost always the best, so really, its just a heirarchy of who gets what for the first several picks.  The only actual 'choice' is at the bottom of the order. Secondly, fighters seem overpowered, while dreadnaughts seem too expensive for their power.  I'm not sure about that, but it worries me.  It seems absolutely critical to build a fight re fleet, or you jsut CANT fight someoen who has such a fleet.  Sure, what capital ships you add to it might be interesting, but it takes so FRICKING long to get the necessary fighter fleet together, and you have to have it, that the ship types loses a lot of its interest for me.     Third, the board setup mechanic, I dont know if I like either.  If you dont get any planets in your hand, you can have nothing decent anywhere near you, and be totally screwed.  Also, it seems that the way you set up, its unfair.  Whoever ends up placing last in a ring is getting screwed, especially if people put blanks near them.  Fourth, the game can often stall out in a 'turtling' excercise.  This makes for a boring 6 hours.  I've sat there for 6 hours and had not participated in a single battle all game.  And for everyone, if you fought someone, it meant the others would pounce on your remains very fast, because battles are so mutually destructive if you dont have overwhelming force.  Also, there often doesnt seem to be much at all to gain from winning battles, except maybe for a certain target due to your card or something.  And if you care about conquest, its because your card forces you to care, and then you only actually care about one location probably, either Mecatol Rex or an enemy home.    Late in the game, you get these huge buildups of 20 fighters and some ship on a location, and your opponent has the same, and if you fight you just annihilate each other and others can walk over you.  Why fight?  Most of the VPs come from taking imperial, and things like having 5 techs, having 3 space docks, paying 10 influence or 6 trade goods, have 1 of each color tech, etc, etc.  I can do that from my little corner of the board, with 5-6 planets next to my homeworld, where I build 6 PDS systems and get deep space cannon so I get 6 free shots at you for comign near me, and just turtle there and fulfill all the non-combat victory conditions and take imperial.   By the time you DO want to beat on someone because they will win, or to fulfill your objective, its so suicidal to do so, you just want someone ELSE to do it, so you can go take the remnants of their empire.  The game also takes FOREVER (around 6 hours, from my several experiences), and you dont seem to get any high level tech (except if you're Jol Nar), until it doesnt matter, because the game is already over.  Either that, or you go entirely for only one certain high level tech, and you get it near the end.  You choose one narrow branch of the tree to go through, out of like three brances that are actually any good.   I really want to like it, but its very difficult.  There isnt a great deal of incentive to attack, and when there is its forced upon you by cards (and the secret objectives seem horribly unbalanced in their difficulty to achieve).  Even then, creating that war with your neighbor is usually suicidal and creates a power vacuum for others near you to rush to take advantage of, as two players fleets are destroyed.  I feel like if I was going to spend 6 hours on a game, it should be Die Macher or something. Fifth, the action cards are rediculously different in power, ranging from things like gain 1 trade good per planet (~6-8), getting a ground unit per planet, or saying 'no one can take initiative this turn, so I keep the speaker and get imperial 2 turns in a row'.  On the flip side, are cards that barely screw one opponent, or that make your War Suns do a slightly better bombard (who fricking cares?).  They are just so wildly different in power that its a total crapshoot. Some of the options, especially distant suns, piss me off.  Actually, distant suns pisses me off so badly it makes me want to quit the game after turn 1 when I flip up radiation and lose everything and get 0 planets, and that other guy gets 3-4 planets and a free spacedock and trade goods or a free tech.  Why play the game if after turn 1 you are screwed due to being far behind in the expansion race, and you have to sit there for another 5 hours to see how you lose?  Or everyone slows down to scout, and it adds an hour to the game.    It really is the case that player 1 must take imperial, player 2 must take initiative, etc.  2 victory points is just such an enormously big part of your score.  There will be a few 1 pointers that come out that are easy, and some guy will get his secret objective for 2, and combined with 2 or 4 from 1-2 takes of imperial, he will win.  If you dont get your 2vps when its your chance, you are just screwed and cant make 10 first, no matter how much you might be killing people militarly.  Not only that, but there is a rediculous advantage to being the first guy to get imperial two times, since then you need only 6 points (6 easy one pointers, or 4 easy ones and an objective).  You just get your second 2 point gain before everyone, and have a tremendous advantage.  Or maybe the second guy to get it.  On the flip side, the guy getting it last is just screwed, as there is no way he gets it twice, and his secret objective merely gets him even with that guy who lucked out and got it twice.  There is just a tremendous disparity between going first (or very early) at the beginning, to going last.  And its because of how broken imperial is (which admittedly, is the 'clock' that makes the game not take  forever).  While its possilbe that a combination of several house rules might fix these various systems (though fixing the turtling problem seems very difficult to me, since there isnt much of any incentive to attack anyway, and you can defend so well with many deep space PDS systems).  So even though it might be fixable, I dont want to have to fix it, and it doesnt seem particularly exciting enough, or give enough cool game for the time investment, to warrant  trying to fix all these mediocre game mechanics.  And thats pretty much how I feel about it, a bunch of mediocre or unexciting or possibly broken game pieces, meshed together to make a very long, 6 hour experience where you sit there and dont get a lot accomplished.  And if you DO go military and manage to do it well without screwing yourself, then some guy has to fricking sit there for HOURS while getting beaten on and having no hope, since he cant possibly win.  I mean, the cool thing about this game is combat.  Late in the game, combat is pretty much suicidal, as even if you overwhelm them and win, you'll lose half your guys and then someone will be able to crush YOU.  If you do it early, when maybe you can catch them unprepared, and it works, then some guys has to suffer through hours of being screwed completely.   Note that my experience was probably more extreme because of playing two four player gmes, where everyone tended to have enough planets.  In the 6 player, some players dont feel that they have enough planets, and are more inclined to attack.  These combats still tend to hurt both players, most of the time, but at least things are more interesting... It feels like a very average, but long and kindof slow/boring game, clouded in a cool theme, and the hype of its coming out.   Yet another thing that annoys me about it is that influence is just so woefully underpowered compared to production.  I just dont care about influence, except to have some planet that gives 3 and no money to get an order token every turn.  Most of the laws are really minor, and the ones that do matter, even though you have 12 influence or whatever, if they decide they are screwing you with it because you're ahead or whatever, you cant really do anything about it.  Or you have all the influence and they play Thugs so you cant vote and screw you.  Whereas the industrial capacity is just so critical to doing anything.  If you get influence planets near you instead of industry, you just get screwed and cant do much of anything, and have trouble getting tech, or a big enough fleet to defend, let alone do anything militarily.  </comment>

Well, if you did, you'll remember that one of the weaknesses of an otherwise great game was that near the end of the game, after you ended your turn, you'd have to wait a very long time, sometimes well over a minute, to take your next turn because of how long the computer took to move all of its pieces. Then you would move your one legion or whatever, end your turn, and wait another minute or two while the computer moved. Well, if you want to relive the old times but with pieces you can touch and wait times 30 times as long, here's your game!</comment>

And still, Roll for the Galaxy manages to be shallower and a less satisfying experience.   RollftG does not offer the same agonizing trade-offs as its mother because you are not closing doors when paying for the cards in your hand. The only good thing left in RollftG is the action selection and leeching, which is now twice as complicated as before. Usually you would expect complex games to have a lot of depth, since you are balancing between many things, but not in RollftG. You just have a number of choices with a myriad of restrictions but none of them seemed very interesting.  Due to the unnecessary and non-rewarding complexity and the lack of trade-offs, I most likely won't play this again.</comment>

I wasn't overly impressed with it, but enjoyed it due to the folks I played with (who love BSG). In our game, we had 3 cylons to deal with at the end, so the humans were just begging for a mercy killing. The game ran long - about 4 hours. Love the theme and the mechanics are surprisingly smart albeit very repetitive. Has nice ebb and flow with cyclons appearing en masse followed by momentary calm after a jump.  All in all, this game is being carried by its theme, the simple fact there are opportunities to be crafty as cylons and obviously fans of the show (or fanboys of FFG) who will crave to play it like a watered down RPG. Others will likely find it only so-so because as a *game* it only serves to carry the accusations of "you're a toaster!".</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United Kingdom">Draw some coloured cards, play some coloured cards, repeat for 2 - 4 hours. Someone will be a cylon , everyone will be accused of being a cylon, it will be funny for the first 30 minutes (you can also have this same enjoyment by calling out to players in the game from another table that they are a cylon - no need to even play it)  I prefer The Resistance instead, 20-30 minutes of pure treachery and then the game is over and you can enjoy another round or another game without having to sit through another 2 hours of BSG. </comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Raw, unadulterated engine building in it's finest deck building form. By itself, the game clips right along at 2p, and the probability of deck drawing gives it enough of a risk management that the engine you create doesn't just sit and crank through until late in the game. I like Trains a little more for the deck building mechanic though as it uses an area influence map, but that suffers from a bad theme implementation (while this doesn't have that problem even if it's sort of pasted-on), leaving this as the deck builder of choice. That said, there is basically zero interaction in Dominion, and it's fundamentally about creating a card combo in your engine and running it as hard as possible. The game ultimate seems to flop over once people learn the combos.  Best on the tablet (even the fugly old edition that was free) where it takes almost no time at all to crank out a game.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="Spain">EL formato legacy le sienta bien a pandemia, pero si no te gusta el juego base....</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="Finland">2016-10-13 As of this writing we are approximately halfway through the campaign. At this point I feel that the game is really about playing the same Pandemic scenario over and over again. The Legacy thing just adds new game mechanics and rules after every round. And the pace at which the game evolves is fast. At first the changes felt exciting and opening the boxes and dossiers was like Christmas. Now I already feel like I couldn't care less. There is a tsunami of rule breaking exceptions flooding out of every box and it is very difficult to maintain interest in learning all of them properly. Your choices do not seem to affect the future too much. In other words, there are apparent no one way doors that would really make you agonize over your decisions.  The game looks absolutely gorgeous though.  2016-11-10 With three quarters of the game cleared I have to say that Pandemic Legacy achieves to do something many other co-ops do not. At least in our group there has been no single dominant alpha player. Instead the experience has truly been a co-operative one. Ironically this is due the fact nobody has been able to maintain interest in the events all the time.  Finally the first ghosts from the past have started to emerge as your earlier decisions begin to have at least some accumulated effect on the outcome of a month. Moreover, the mystery behind the background story has started to unravel. In my opinion it is quite late for this story arc to develop as the early to mid-game is more or less predictable basic stuff.   I still do not think this is a bad game and I definitely want to play this through. But at the same time I am eager to finish.  2016-11-17 4 months, 7 sessions, 19 games and 20-25 hours (depending on whether you include the time spent on setting up and cleaning). That is how long it took for us to finish the whole campaign. Was it worth it? Hard to say. The game had its moments but in the end, it was still the same Pandemic over and over again. My primary motivation to keep playing stemmed from Pandemic Legacy being the current No. 1 rated game on BGG and as a boardgame hobbyist I felt obliged to go through the experience myself.   In some games we had really really bad luck (the quickest defeat came in six turns) while in other games we felt invincible right from the start. So, the spectrum of luck in the game can be quite wide. We finished the game with a score of 541 points which I would guess to be close to the average. This is also in line with my gut feeling that we had average luck.  That being said, my final thought about the game is that our actions had little to no effect on the final outcome as our month-to-month success was mostly dictated by the luck of draw. Of course, the upgrades we chose during the game made the following months easier but still I did not once think that we had any kind of decisive edge over the fate that was shuffled into the two decks of cards. Perhaps the last two months were an exception when our highly debated decisions in November actually allowed us to win December in the nick of time.   The standard BGG rating system clearly does not work with legacy games. I do not have any desire to play Pandemic Legacy ever again because it is a one time experience. This would be in line with a rating of 3-4. However, at the same time the game works well because it has the same tested and proved Pandemic mechanics running under the hood. Thus the game should be rated a SIX. In the end, I think I am more inclined to rate Pandemic Legacy a FIVE. I did not find the legacy mechanic to enhance the game enough to justify a playing time of 25 hours. This is primarily because your decisions do not alter the course of the game enough and there is only one way to finish the campaign. At the moment, I'd rather play a 60min game of the original Pandemic than commit to playing Season 2 for another 25 hours. However, I fear the latter is inevitable...</comment>

However duration is so long that I propably won't end playing this again. That is what lowers the score quite a lot. Game was good but I'm just not a fan of long games.

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="Italy">[First impressions] Too long and expensive for what it has to offer, despite its fascinating theme. Card driven in a perverse way: the cards make most of the game, not the players. You have to learn most of them, the phase in which they come up and, even then, you must consider if other specific cards have already being played or not, limiting your choices even more. Some rules are unnecessarily fiddly, others are just too luck ridden (the space race, of course) and having recently played Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has made some of this points even more obvious. It shares with Hannibal one of its biggest flaws, at least from my point of view: just too long for the amount of luck involved.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">7/7/16: The Theme is strong in this one.  First impressions, needlessly complicated.  Playing teams can get very frustrating.  Like all FFG games, you're buying this for the theme, not the gameplay.  If you don't love Star Wars, I'd stay away from this.  If you're used to wargames, the clunky and swingy combat will be frustrating.  Only FFG  would have come up with dice symbols meaning one thing on one type of roll, and something else on another roll.  What you do get is a very thematic game, with a great story and a ton of great plastic.  You do need to learn what possibilities are made available via the cards, the first time through you're just trying to learn the game.  The cards do cause some wild swings, but that's the nature of the game.  I think that the length is going to kill it for me, but will need more plays to really know.  I don't mind 4 hours of Fury of Dracula, because you're working with a team, but here where it's just one on one, it's a little long for what it offers.  It may also be that I'm slowly burning out on the FFG game style where so much of the game is on cards.  The tactics cards in this game really remind me of the Battlestar Galactica game where your card draws really determine everything.  I don't think that 4 player works all that well unless you have 2 people that work really well together.  The rolls aren't that well defined, and you have to go through everything together which slows things down further..   Learning 2 player game: 4 hours, 4 player game 5.5 hours</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">First the good - the game mostly looks great, the rules are not bad (for FFG), minis are cool, and the asymmetric player goals are interesting.  But there is a lot of junk here, the game is inelegant, full of useless and sometimes counterproductive complexity and chrome and the combat is terrible.  Not sure about the balance yet either, I suspect the Imperial player has a slight advantage that is magnified by Rebel inexperience - but I'm almost positive that I will not want to play enough games to find out.  Oh, did I mention the game is long?  Too long by at least an hour.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Germany">A 5 might be a bit harsh, usually I'd give this game for the experience that I had a 6.  This rating isn't because of a devastating loss, I actually won my first and only play of it. But it became pretty clear that this game has a runaway leader problem, which probably has to be balanced out by the other players having to unite against the leading player. That the game manual requests that people refrain from actually keeping count of who is ahead in points and how many points are to be gained by an action doesn't help, it seems like it just wants to mask this issue. In our case, it was a little race at the beginning, but the game was pretty much decided after three or four turns, and this in part to the initial setup and the very first random encounter. After half of the game, we could have stopped, the outcome was clear and there was no possibility at all that I could see for the other player to get back into the game, without having done anything wrong himself when playing the game. The unbalanced secret goal cards probably added to this: While one of mine was a breeze to accomplish, both of the other player were rather hard to fulfill.  The game is definitely playable, as in: the game mechanics are working together, but they don't complement each other well enough. When looking under the hood, leaving all that bling (the opulent visuals of the game) behind, the mechanics seem to be tackered together so that there is just some variation and choice for a change of the game state when playing. Despite it seeming very complex at start and when looking at it on the table, there is actually very little "game" to be found in this one.  In hindsight, the game hints at being deep and immersive, but actually there isn't much to it. The only good thing about this is, it's actually quite easy to teach. If you want a game that is designed a lot better with a gameplay similar to this one, then I'd recommend to get Eclipse or Terra Mystica, for example. Skip this one instead.</comment>

    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Finland">Due to hype my expectations for the game were high. The game has outstanding production quality, but otherwise it didn&#8217;t feel any special. Scythe tries to be robust by having the same kind of controlling mechanisms as used for example in Terra Mystica. In the game you keep forgetting to use your benefits, since they are not given in clear phases as in TM. Scythe tries to be thematic in its fantasy world, but the theme is basically integrated to the plastic components of the game. Also, you expect Scythe to be conflict oriented game. However, the number of combats is limited since after the second successful battle there is really no point of attacking anyone.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Best at 2 and maybe 3, and above that it really drags. I find that I really like the sandbox effect and relaxed feeling of the "feed your people" side-quest compared to Agricola, but you still sit and contest just a couple spaces on the (ever growing) board; the furnishing spot, which is unfortunate (mostly because I'm only passively interested in worker placement as an action draft mechanism). One of my favorite games to solo, I found it best (regardless of solo play or with other people) if you draft in roughly 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the furnishings instead of everything, otherwise the game becomes stale way too quickly. One other thing that I particularly don't like about the game is that it *requires* an organizer, otherwise it takes too long to setup/tear down to justify playing. Second, I found it encourages specialization in the cave so you spend most of your time jockeying for the furnish action.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Finland">2014-11 Comparison with Agrigola is obvious here. So similar the games are. In Caverna I liked the way you could upgrade your workers to make them more efficient. But that is really the only reason I would play Caverna over Agrigola.  The sheer amount of information the players are exposed to right from the beginning was so overwhelming here, that I almost lost interest in trying to figure the game out. But what amazed me the most, was that towards the end you seemed to have very little to do despite all the options given to you. Oh, I am sure that after a few more plays you would be familiar with the game allowing you to concentrate more on your strategy.   But why bother? Essentially, Caverna offers very few new experiences to veterans of Agricola and Le Havre. Instead, the game is more cluttered and fiddly lacking the elegance of its predecessors. I also preferred the way, how in Agricola you are trying to find the best way to utilise the randomly drawn cards instead of a prescribed selection of buildings. In short, there are too many components to setup, too much information to digest on your first few plays, too many options to choose from, and still too little to do towards the end of the game.  I would play Caverna if asked, but I won't spend any more time on learning it.  2015-01 6-&gt;5 </comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Variable Phase Selection, fast play, low downtime, (generally) playing against players (not the game, although it is through indirect mechanical interaction more than anything else), and a long supply chain really amount to a decent game overall. The greatest coup was getting my parents to play game after game after game. Two downsides are that you either need more buildings, or content to deal with your existing options as it's a static setup. Second, it is the namesake of the problem that many other "seat-order dependency" games suffer from where it's the responsibility of the person next to you to keep you in check more so than players across the table. Really fiddly in my experience, although I suppose some of that can be reduced. I loathe the instruction manual. I understand why this is considered Seyfarth's star accomplishment.  Update; This is a game that I find I enjoy best when I binge and I think that's because of the setup time. For some reason the second and third game generally make me happier than the first one of an evening, so it rarely comes out anymore. It's a game that I love playing it with a select group of people (my parents at holidays), but that's it.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">To me, this game is sort of a "multiplayer chess"... It can be too scripted, and if you play against really good opponents, you're sure to get your ass kicked with less gaming satisfaction then if you lost other eurogames.

It is a glorified card game that feels too drawn out and chaotic, with lots of downtime and too much luck and AP for my taste.   In the good and the bad it has the hallmarks of a Vlaada Chvatil design: some neat ideas, but ultimately feels like it's lacking proper development to truly realise its potential. Now it feels like it's stuck in a clunky prototype stage.   I like some of the visuals, but overall the component quality does not impress me. I'd say it needs more plays to properly grok it, but ATM it doesn't interest me that much.   Horribly expensive. </comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="">After A: NR did so well in Geek Madness a couple of years ago I decided to give it a try. There are a couple of really nice things about the game. First of all the extremely asymmetric game play makes it so that the corp player and the runner play by their own set of rules. Second is the way the corp uses hidden information to try to control the runner, while the runner tries to predict what the corp is doing. These two elements not only create a compelling dynamic with regard to player interaction but are the foundation for the themes the game is exploring.  Unfortunately it's an LCG. This undermines player interaction by putting too much focus on analyzing a constantly evolving card set. And what you get in the starter set just isn't good enough when compared to similar games. The fact that the game is built around being endlessly expandable means the base set comes with a whole lot of extra rules baggage you only need if you are going to do a lot of deck building.  If you want a two player pseudo CCG without having to play the "meta" game get FFG's brilliant [thing=147154]Blue Moon Legends[/thing]. While asymmetric, it doesn't have the extreme asymmetry of A: NR. But it does have all the mind games and player interaction, without the rules overhead.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Finland">Android Netrunner has quite an interesting theme and all the jargon used in the game adds to the atmosphere (although I have to say that it makes learning the game a lot harder). Fog of war is also nicely executed with the corporation player playing his defenses face down. Figuring out the best combos from your cards is fun as well.  After a few plays the bad stuff kicks in, though. It is extremely boring to play the corporation. You are basically just sitting there waiting for the runner player to attack or waiting for the scoring cards to appear. I guess it says enough if you use the word "wait" twice in a sentence. Moreover, the rulebook is as bad as you can expect from Fantasy Flight Games. It is absolutely useless if you are trying to find some important rules. All rules having a big impact on the game play (the maximum Memory Units the Runner has at his disposal, for example) should be at least bolded or made stand out from the rest of the text. But no. Now everything is scattered all over the rulebook and some rules cannot be even found under the title explicitly referring to them making it impossible to find the piece of information you need quickly.   I definitely cannot understand how this is so popular of a game. Yes, I can see that there a good qualities to it but to me it felt unexciting and shallow. Oh, I know that some (or most) people don't agree with the shallow part, but if it takes tens of plays to see the depth, I won't be doing it. The few plays I have under my belt were enough to convince me against of buying this game.</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Some thoughts I had after two different evenings (6-7 games): Neat game, but overpriced for what you get. By the end of the first evening, a couple of us had figured out that the game turns and sort of breaks when you get someone as a codemaster who is really good at concept association (and thus good at being the ghost in Mysterium, the clue giver in Concept, etc). The people who just did straight association of words (e.g. "Musicians, 2" and yields "Kid, Rock") had a much rougher/tense go at it than the people who did conceptual linking to examples (e.g. "Jurisdiction, 6" and ended up with London, New York, Australia, Bermuda, etc which just sort of ends the game). The difference is you can still get screwed by interpretation of the dream cards in Mysterium (or just get a shitty draw) where as it just sort of falls over here. Reminds me of Set in that regard (where skill imbalance is a key factor). Second, the game dragged ass above 9 players. The discussion phase lags because you're waiting in lock step for a clue to be given where as in Mysterium you can be working on someone else's clue while you wait for your own. Our best games we had in that regard were at 5p, maybe 6p. Above that, and I'd probably break up into two groups and play something else. I think one of the most telling things is that with Mysterium, we played that until they made us go home every week for like 6 weeks, where as this, we played for maybe 2 hours and everyone was ready for something new after just the first week (both groups on different days even...) It's a game I'll play if it shows up (and there isn't anything else to play right off hand), but I'd never buy it.  almost a year later, I find it's ok (still just a 5), but it improves some if you use dixit cards instead of words. Codenames Pictures (this fall) uses a similar twist. Baring that, I think it should be a requirement that there are no single guess clues.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">I had heard a lot of buzz around this game before I got the chance to play it, and at the time I didn't get what all the excitement was about.  Having now played it, I have to say... I still don't get it.  Well, maybe I can see why other people like it, but it just doesn't do it for me.  The game is very thin on theme which, being a Eurogamer, doesn't usually bother me so long as the game is interesting mechanically, but this one falls flat in that regard as well.  This game is highly prone to analysis paralysis if you don't use a timer (which I didn't in any of my plays), resulting in most players sitting around doing nothing while one or a small portion of players thinks long and hard.  The play time on the box says 15 minutes, but our games took more like 30, and it felt like more than 30 due to the down time.  There's very little thinking or planning you can do outside of your own turn unless you are a clue-giver, which makes the down time more pronounced.  The limitation of single word clues is highly restrictive, and trying to give clues about a randomly selected group of words is even more restrictive.  It's extremely difficult to come up with clues that will lead to more than 2 answers unless the board favors such clues, and even if you could come up with such a clue, odds are it would be so obscure or convoluted that your teammate(s) would never guess it.  Typically the best you can hope to accomplish in a turn is to get two answers correct, usually with the second one being a bit of a toss-up.  I usually agree with the adage that restrictions breed creativity, but the restrictions in this game feel so much so that it chokes out creativity.  Additionally, it's very hard to carry any information over from turn to turn.  Usually you will find the clues your teammate was going for, meaning you are back to square one the next round.  Blindly guessing is not a valid strategy except in desperate situations as you can hit an opponent's word or, worse, hit the assassin and lose straight out (which is not only disappointing for the losing team, but is a rather lame way to win).  I generally find Vlaada Chvatil games overly fiddly with an excessive number of rules, and while I don't find this game fiddly, I do find it too confining.  I don't know whether it would be better off with more rules or less, but I do know this isn't a game for me.  If I want to play a game that involves giving clues and trying to think like someone else, I will reach for Dixit or Mysterium instead.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Germany">Altough I love Coop games, this one didn't do it for me, awful rulebook, clunky game mechanics and in a group there is a high risk, that someone takes over and makes all the decisions for the group.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Sweden">Good quality components but some of the cards are badly translated and generally lacking in editing. Since this is supposed to be a game that tells a story, poor language really detracts from the experience and prevents you from really immersing yourself in the theme.   Both setup and gameplay is too fiddly for me, with different tokens and counters and resources constantly being moved around.  The rules are not bad per se, but they could have been implemented better. Lots of questions arise in the details, and there is much potential for human error.  All things considered the game is mediocre. They should hire some author or something to edit and re-write the cards in english. A thematic game like this, if any, should have a lot of great flavor text.  A bit more creativity and a few more positive effects among the event-cards would make the game more fun. Also the wording on the effects should be more consistent.</comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">A very good game but there's not enough here to interest me.  It's about building an engine, of sorts, in order to score more VP than your opponents.  But the engine is assembled in pieces and you don't know most of the major VP parts until Autumn (the third season).  Also, the person or persons who lose out on the boats get screwed on meeples and meeples = power so they're really kicked in the shins.  The disparity there really annoys me, as does the fact that the engine is obtuse until the game unfolds enough to inform you.  Not for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">It's a beautiful design with lots of nifty parts. But it doesn't work for me. I think the problem is that it feels aimless. I don't feel like I can form a long term strategy, and the moment to moment scramble feels a bit random.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="">Was expecting much more after reading comments. Turns out the meeples got from the bag have a strong effect to the auctions, if you don't get the right color you are out from some auctions, or if one player gets the final season (winter) tile you were looking at, you are done. Too bad because it could have been one of the best game for 6 players. A missed opportunity.</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">I really wanted to like this game, and I did.  At least until half way through the game when we discovered that the game had a huge and utterly ridiculous design flaw, which entirely ruined it.  It's possible to spend half of the game building a perfectly good engine for making money, only to have someone - in a single move - completely destroy that engine for the game.  This isn't just bad planning, mistakes or bad luck - this is just a basic flaw in the design of the game.    In our very first play, we had a situation where a player was competitive for the first half of the game - but one move by another player just killed the game for that player (and it wasn't even remotely aimed at hurting the player), who then spent the second half (about an hour and a half) of the game losing money (no matter what they did) and it was really obvious as soon as it happened that this was going to be the case.  Apologists for this horribly overrated game will argue that you can avoid this situation [i]once you know about it[/i], but you shouldn't have to [i]plan[/i] to avoid a clear flaw in the game.  Long games with such a huge flaw should be avoided like the plague...</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United Kingdom">Ok, I should know better, but after a fairly brutal first game I'm going to rate this one as there isn't a huge desire to play again - too long &amp; too much downtime, which I don't see improving significantly with familiarity. It's undoubtedly clever, and has some wickedly humorous touches regarding market forces &amp; competition, but for me  it felt too big and sprawling. My other main gripes are that the milestones and single availability cards simply rankled, as did the forced completion of full orders -  customers might see advertising for beer, burgers and pizza, but should they really have to buy them all or not buy anything?</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="">Probably the best game of the year. Heavy, many different strategies and mean gameplay. It may have a problem of lacking a catch up mechanism. Players may be out if game to early in the game.   Updated: lower my rating   from 9 to 6.5. Played this game 3 more times, and we did not finished none, because at middle game one player had the lead and everybody knew he will be the winner. This game has a very serious problem of run way leader, and the richest gets richer even with players at the same level, and does not have any catch up mechanism. I will play one more time, but if this happens again, I will sell my game and lower my rating. Its only me the only one who sees it?</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Germany">Some established mechanisms mixed and with some new twists could have made for a nice worker placement game. But the characters seems unbalanced, und so the whole game. Just getting goods and fulfilling contracts is quite easy and mostly successful (especiall with mercator), and mostly the player who almost ignores the travelling (except a few easy moves), which is suppoed to be the core of the game, wins. Among players who have played only few games, that is. The game may turn out to be well balanced among experienced players, but it is not among beginners in this game. Furthermore it leaves a bad feeling, that the easiest way to be succesful is imore or less ignoring the whole travelling part, and simply getting goods and selling them through contracts, so reducing the game to a very simple stupid game.</comment>

Amazingly fun solo -- this would come to the table more often if set-up wasn't a pain (but, again, it's easier than Arkham).   *edit: dropped from 8 to 5.   Almost fully expanded, but has grown bloated and bland under the weight. Not a lot of cool content added to the game, and (more often than not) sessions last too long and aren't very engaging.   Nightmare to put away too (all the little cards and bits!). </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Denmark">Axis &amp; Allies on (a)steroids. When you add a ton of luckbased features to a game where luck is already the main factor, you still end up with the sort of game where luck has more to say than actual strategy. Surprisingly few things happens during the many hours of play and the different options in the game adds only little challenge. For someone who drool over themes like 'starwars' and galaxies far far away this might be the top, but I'm not that someone. To me its an average game, nothing spectacular.</comment>

Come-from-behind wins are possible largely because those in front are busy getting smacked.  To me, that's not a fun game design.  But like I said above, others will love this.

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="England">Initial view after just one play, so too early to form any real judgement. Enjoyed the theme and the added complexity but it has likely lost the marvellous simplicity of SJ. It certainly felt pretty solitaire which was compounded by the fact that we couldn't easily see what cards the other players had laid. Contrast SJ where its easy to see who has played what, and how your choices will aid or constrain them. Clearly familiarity with the icons is necessary before giving a considered rating.  Played 2 players twice tonight - the icons are pretty much fine and it's a better game with 2 players rather than 4 I think. How the forthcoming expansions with added players will fare will be interesting to see. I still have a feeling that the game is a touch fiddly for what it is, and the player interaction (at least in the base game) remains limited. It's partly my advancing years that lead me to like vanilla best, so SJ will likely remain my favourite of the two!</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">This game just isn't that fun to play. At first, it was terribly difficult to grok, although after introducing it to a few folks, gamers seem to get it pretty quickly. In brighter light, the brown/orange color blind problem is much less although still annoying. But for me it reduces itself to a random puzzle game: you play the hand you're dealt and after that, it greatly depends on the cards you get with the advantage going not to skill, but knowledge of the deck - a trait I particularly dislike in a game. Yes, there are important decisions, but I believe it's much more based on luck favoring the prepared. It is Magic the Gathering without deck building. Is that a great game? I don't think so at all. Ironically, Dominion is the opposite: deck building without any difficult or interesting cards. Dominion works for me, this one simply does not.</comment>

At the beginning you don't really know what you are doing, especially if you haven't played before and don't know the cards and how scoring works presented with a chaos of options in a very large map of the world. It deals with cold war which is my favourite historical subject but it isn't a war-game it is rather a political game (yawn). Update: I have not played this game forever, I can't find anyone to play it with, it has a very inferior solo house-ruled mode which is tedious to play and it has area-control euro-style mechanics which combined with bluffing are enough to put me off, it's up for trading </comment>

These multiple steps just introduce unnecessary phases into the game to make it more complex than what the depth of the game would allow for.  2013/12 6 -&gt; 5 With more games setting the standard for a 6, this is clearly a 5.  2015/01 5 -&gt; 6 Have to raise this back to a 6. We played this quite a bit before Finnish Nationals in 2014 and I started to appreciate the design, although I still do not enjoy the game as much as some other games. This is primarily due to the nature of the game that you are more or less programming your whole game in the beginning instead of devising things on the fly. And should you deviate even one step from the optimal path, you lose.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Canada">I may review my rating after few more plays but as it stands now, to me it is a tasteless Victory Points salad with a fantasy dressing.  Traded away after 3 plays.  Not my type.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="New Zealand">Point salad fans rejoice! Sadly I am not one.  Only one play so far, and I won decisively. Hopefully gets more interesting with more plays. </comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Singapore">And so it comes to past....i've tried TM once and I do have some pretty good feeling about it but similarly the amount of bad vibes do add to it as well.  The board is not modular, so its going to be same-same for repeated plays. Black is there, red is up there and blue hugs the river, etc.  As a Civ game, it lacks confrontation. the only 'war-ish' behaviour comes from opponents taking what you need first or just so happens there was nothing else they can do thus, they expand their territory in that pattern for that particular game session. Gamers expanded, as there was minimal choice, not because it was a strategy. It's not a game, so much as to screw your opponents up that creates confrontation, but its just a simple turn taking event that lead to a certain condition that is 'left by what is available to do.' The options are not 'always' available. Thus I do not see how this game could be that Civ-vy. Once you are there, you are there. period. Not for resources per se, but the changing/upgrading of structures brings new powers and completely removes the old. There is no 'stack em up' ladder.  removing all the beautiful art work, and what we have is a simple exercise of take A to get B and take B to Get C. That's good.....but you have to throw away A and B for that C.  Lots of game have been there and done that. There was no 'situational' gaming aspect that makes it a game to concentrate on. (Like a wargame about stalingrad, even though it may be the same situational battle, the outcome hovers on an expected antagonistic play. Further randomnised by uncertainty in dice rolling....)  Having said that, its a fun exercise with the right group of gamers. Especially those that hate confrontational wipeouts. The lack of random dice does create a math calculation kind of game play.  Beautiful components and artwork. Gameplay is smooth with some decision making in the beginning, but reduces dramatically near end game.  An above average game.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Canada">Initial thoughts: nice, tactical, war-type game, marred by its length. Feels a bit too whack-a-moleish but I wonder if further plays would allow more exploration of the tactical options. Might need a few more plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">I really enjoy this game, I think the mechanisms are intuitive, the game flows well, it's very strategic, every action makes sense, and I feel like every bit of the game meshes together very well. However, the game does drag a bit and if you play this game with someone who in the slightest might not enjoy longer games or is not a very experienced gamer, their confusion and ultimate dislike of the game really makes it unplayable. I have no one to play this game with and it's unlikely I'll find someone anytime soon, so that's why my rating is averaged out to where it is.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">I have had the opportunity to playtest this game in wave 3 and have played in 6 times in less than 2 weeks!  This game is fabulous, and definitely one of a kind.  The end game condition is similar to Euphoria where it ends on stars, but having the vp multiplier based on territories, stars and resources takes it up a notch. Not only do you have to be worried about the last star going out, but you also have to keep track of your popularity.  There is so much good to be said about this game, I enjoy it the most with 3 players and we were typically able to finish a game in under 75 minutes.  There are not very many games that pack so much punch in such a short time. Highly recommended!</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United Kingdom">Very fluid and attractive game but after a few plays I don't have a burning desire to play it again. Although you get to make a good number of decisions for the playtime, I don't find many of them particularly interesting. Your overall strategy is mostly determined by the action board you get because the 2/3 coin bonuses are impossible to ignore.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">1 play / 5 players  LIKE: So many powers to explore, and a lot of different setups. Having the two board combo was interesting. Beautiful art and highly produced bits. The war tension was fun and not overly threatening (except at the end).   DISLIKE: Our game went very long. I felt the mid-game stalled and I became bored. Some player powers are clearly better than others. The encounter cards were boring. Fiddly. The theme did not add anything for me.  OVERALL: This game plays very similar to Antike, but Antike plays faster and feels streamlined. Scythe does have its fun moments, but it also had moments where my turn didn't feel that interesting, so it would drag a little. I'd rather play Terra Mystica, or Viticulture-- Scythe relies too much on its theme to elevate it above the hordes of modern games. </comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">There is a lot to teach with this game and for my group, its unfortunate that the first few rounds are basically just figuring out how everything works. It is easy to catch on after a bit, but I doubt if I would want to bother teaching it to anyone else or if my group would want to play again. I'd play again if I didn't have to teach.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Spain">Baked on Kickstarter, but not as good as i expect.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Finland">Not for 5 players. Too much downtime. Took 4 hours instead of 115 minutes. (including explaining the rules). May be good with 3.   Even this game has battles, it is tame. You can't ruin your opponent's game.   Collectors edition's components were superb.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">1st play: Thematically this game is awesome.  Post-war mechs being repurposed as farm support, limited but purposeful combat and an amazing production with metal coins, giant board and plastic mechs.  In terms of mechanics I'm not so sure.  It felt like there was more downtime than there should have been, and very little interaction between players.  The optimization game of trying to double up actions made for some thinky bits and when you pull off a combo it's satisfying.  As always, I hate when games could easily have equal turns but choose not to.  2nd play: After said and done, an average game.  The mechanics feel a little more clunky than they need to (with dual actions each move but each player having different combos of dual actions it's hard to keep track of each other player's playerboard.  Knowing which factions can go to which terrain types and which factions combo trading with mechs vs trading with enlist.  The result is a pretty multi-player solitaire game.  The theme is great though.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Singapore">Worker placement light, combat 'dune' type light, wargame bloodless light as you don't even need to rebuild. Theme is great but not important. Miniatures are pretty nice but not exactly necessary. General overall production is of great value.  The removing cubes to gain more and cost less for second action is not new, but works fine here. I can understand why there are only six stars needed to end the game, as most resources within the player playmat would have been exhausted. Small feel of Agricola meets Dune.   The end game boils down to coins, with area control and resources being measured for success. No victory objective. Just senseless battles for an area that may not even be connected to your empire.   Cards add a more variety to victory and makes the game already chaotic as it is. Kemet feel to it, but thematically weaker.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">The game has no arc. It has an anti-climacfic and abrupt ending. There is a serious runaway leader problem. I can usually tell who is likely to win halfway through, and there is rarely anything anyone can do about it. This is largely because the methods of interaction in this game are so extraordinarily unsatisfying.  You can "attack" people, but only occasionally and situationally will you really hurt them. Combat feels empty and flat. There are rarely serious consequences to losing a combat. In fact, good combat decisions are virtually always pre-scripted if players are playing competently. It's an incredibly important and yet lifeless aspect of the game.  I'm not saying scythe is all bad. It has a unique character and some interesting euro decisions. But I believe that scythe is also about an inch deep and a mile wide. It looks and feels epic. But the weight of decisions are somewhat flimsy and largely about being slightly more efficient than the other guys and gals. The asymmetrical player boards are all different flavors of the same thing. Practically the only difference from game to game is if your faction synergizes especially well with your player board or not.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Canada">Well designed game. Gorgeous art and great production values too. However not my kind agame as too much emphasis on efficiency and engine. More work and less fun. Surely needs a few more plays to get  good grip on the engine.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="">A well designed, 4X civilization builder that reminds me of both Eclipse and Clash of Cultures, which are both very worthy designs.  Of the three, I might actually prefer Scythe which is saying something, in part, because I like the variable starting conditions and the way victory points are distributed at the end using popularity, objectives (stars), hexes controlled, and resources controlled.     The art is dystopic, appropriate to its theme, and the components in the collectors edition are top notch.  Combat seems to be dialed at about the right level.  Our five player game played surprisingly well for that player count.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">Interesting game, not what i expected.  Its kind of WW1 dystopian agricola.  This game tryies to do alot .. but at first play does none of it well.. Is it an AT or Euro??? i think it tries to fool you its the prior when in fact its the latter..</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Sweden">I like it better than regular Agricola because the gameplay is slightly simpler and with clearer iconography. Too bad the scoring is the same and just as boring.  Overrated.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="">Yes, this is a pretty good game but c'mon, is Uwe in a contest to see how many components he can make in a game or what? I don't like having to look at 50+ tiles to see which room works for me and I don't like the game enough to become familiar with them. There's certainly more choices of actions than in Agricola but still not enough for my taste. </comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">I think this fixes all of the issues from the original 7 wonders and turns it into a strategic balanced game. The core of the play is just drafting from a card pyramid but the strategy comes in on when you buy, when you sell and when you might need to use a wonder to offset card balance so you can take another turn.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">Cheap components, excessive set-up, boring. Barely remember it. </comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">2 plays / 2 players  LIKE: Drafting cards, and the engine mechanisms are interesting and fun. Analyzing what cards to pick up that may free other cards is engaging.  DISLIKE: Iconography is complex, but after a couple plays they make sense.  OVERALL: Fun little game, plays smooth. </comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">Had fun, would like to play again</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="">Fine 2 Player game. Unfortunately I cannot play this with the same person twice. I have never had a close game of this. It has always been incredibly one sided. Balancing issues.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="">I love the original 7 Wonders, even the two player variant. I've played this one a good 6 or so times and while I think it is a good game, I don't think it captures the tension of the original. The decisions don't seem to weigh so heavily.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">The biggest advantage is playing time, but way too heavy on luck</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">1st play: This captures a lot of the feel of 7 wonders, and I like the idea that it's possible to win with science or military now.  The game is fast, and the draft is clever.  I'm not a huge fan of 7 wonders, I'm always willing to play tho, and this is a suitable replacement for 7 wonders when there's only 2 players.  Because almost every card comes out every game, I don't know how similar repeat plays will feel.  2nd play: The game is fine, true to the original 7 wonders.  I'm not a huge fan of 7 wonders, though I won't turn down a game.  I've never felt the need to own it and this implementation feels the same to me.  The problem is, one of the strengths of 7 wonders is the flexibility of player counts.  Duel gives that up.  Plenty of 2p games I'd rather play.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">Excellent for two players.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">Only played it once so far, and while it was not a bad experience, it also failed to wow me (I may have simply had too high of expectations due to the hype rave reviews from multiple sources).  Still prefer its bigger brother with 5-7 players for the best 7-wonders experience.  Maybe it will grow on me once I get more plays, but Lost Cities, San Juan and Mr Jack are still my "go to" games for 2 players.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Spain">Too much hype. </comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Italy">A great game, with clever and well crafted mechanics, but I'm afraid it's not my cup of tea.  The role selection model is simple and functional, reducing downtime and overall playing time. It also helps beginners in learning the game, with each player going through each selected phase every turn, an useful bonus for a game that doesn't lack its complexities: from the specific rules of each role to the proper understanding of the various buildings.  On the long run the gameplay seems to rarely diverge from a limited number of optimum strategies, also being, quite often, really sensitive to the number of players and their skill level. Interaction is limited to selecting roles and buildings that can advantage you more than your opponents and not selecting the ones that do the opposite, but, to me, it still feels like a multiplayer optimization rush with almost no direct interplay and little space for errors.  Still, a really good piece of work per se.  Rio Grande version. Simple but solid and functional components. Not really impressed by the text-only building tiles: function over form, I suppose, but even a small illustration could have been the final touch (the San Juan based alternative, here on the Geek, is a good example). Really good rulebook. </comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="">The first time I tried this I thought: That's it? I much prefer the different choices the cards in Agricola have to offer, vers. the few buildings you can build in Puerto Rico.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United Kingdom">Solid design but for my money Race for the Galaxy killed this game before I even knew it existed - it plays quicker, its decisions are at least as satisfying and it has a higher skill ceiling (albeit with more luck too).</comment>

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Pros: plays fairly quickly; simple mechanics; tricky short-term vs. long-term strategies; decent components (though you can't read the buildings' text without picking them up or referring to a cheat sheet).  Cons: so-so theme (Plantation owner???); small player interaction (with some auto-play turns and lots of dependence on other player's role choices); somewhat unforgiving of play mistakes (especially early on). No dice rolling.  Conclusion: it's a successful game because it works as printed. The game does get fairly heavy in the late stages and some players will have brain lock-up (yours truly) over a crucial decision (followed by brain fatigue after the game). It's not a game that I would seek out to play (like in tournaments) but if others clamored to play it, I'd reluctantly join in. </comment>

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Austria">Very well designed but it feels soulless to me...</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Wales">The game involves placing tiles, as in Glen More, to activate abilities and score points. The tiles selected are not chosen by a rondel, as in Glen More, but by rolling two dice and using tokens to manipulate the resources, as in La Venise Du Nord. Set-collection plays a  big role, gathering multiple tiles of the same colour scores you points and completing a coloured region gives you further bonuses, as in Thurn and Taxis. The rules explanation is fairly long due to the amount of tiles available with different features, but the game is an enjoyable puzzle, if a little dry.  Traded with expansions for Furstenfeld.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">1 plays / 2 players  LIKE: building stuff, combos DISLIKE: fiddly. low player interaction. many icons that need to be looked up for first time players. the wife was unimpressed. OVERALL: likable game, but the theme is very dry. it would take a few plays to get faster and see the subtleties of the game. </comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="">Great game, although can be a little slow... best with 2, or 3 quick players.  Wouldn't play with 4.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Austria">I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  This is the first "Victory Points Salad" that I tried. The Castles of Burgundy is a good game clearly, even fun in many aspects, but I don't like the feeling that it gives me. The game looks like "butter scraped over too much bread"... there're just too many ways to get points, which makes everything seem kinda pointless (no pun intended).  Also the components are HORRIBLE, like I saw also in other Feld's games. The board looks messy and abstract and my OCD screams of pain every time I see the curves at the end of the scoring track.</comment>

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Italy">Nice game, I found it quite enjoiable. Anyway all the green on the boards make me have an headache so 0.5 less.

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Canada">Welcome to action-paralysis hell.  Great game if you have players who can plan contingencies for their contingent contingencies knowing exactly what they're going to do on their turn no matter how other players before them act. Otherwise just pop a bag of popcorn and watch some paint dry because that would be a more enjoyable and efficient use of your time. . .  Also, the rulebook for this edition could likely fall under the category of "crime against humanity", do yourself a favor and download the headless hollow summary and print one for all of your players.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Fantastic game, but after 100 plays I don't feel like I'm getting anything else out of it.  Still, those were a great 100 plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Finland">Would like to try.. Love the Civ-like theme, but the game seems very fiddly and really ugly, so I'm not too excited..  ***  Took me ages before I finally got to try this one.. It also took us ages (4 hours) to finish our 3-player game.  My first impression is really torn. I love Civ and this does give me some of that good old Civ-feeling. At the same time it gives me a lot of the micromanagement and tedious bookkeeping I really don't care for. The mechanics are pretty ingenious, but overall the fiddliness bothers me. I understand the elegant abstraction of the design, but I do miss a map.. When I think of a Civilization game, I'm thinking of something beefier than a glorified card game. I also have a problem with the butt-ugly art and graphic design. The main thing - the progress through the ages - flows quite beautifully, though.. although it does take it's time!  So.. I love parts of it, but for my taste it's too ugly, too fiddly and plain too long, and I don't see myself playing it very often.. This knocks points off the design, that is otherwise pretty impressive. I'll settle for a 7. Also, it's definitely too pricey for what you get. </comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">I've played a basic game and the middle game... this one is wonderful! The multitude of cards allows for lots of customization of your civilization, and I really feel like you can create an empire with a unique feel and style of play. The game plays smoothly and keeps you engaged the entire time... you can tell that they put a lot of work into this one. I hope it gets reprinted soon!</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Looks way to heavy and way too long to get people to play this game. I like games that hit the table often and one my wife will play with me. I would like to try it sometime though and look to learning a big heavy game like this. It must be good for it to be ranked so high</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Very solid game. But not one I would want to actively ask to play. For the time I would much rather play something else. So far the only Vlaada game that I have played and didn't fall in love with. </comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">:cry: :) :D :) This is a perfectly serviceable and well-made ultra-long game. It didn't amaze me the way my top three ultra-long games (18xx, Twilight Struggle, Maria) do. But it's a LOT more fun than some things I've played of roughly equal length. It's got a bit too much direct confrontation via military actions to ever really be a favorite, but I'd at least be willing to try this one again (we played the Advanced game with just two ages and honestly if one player was not taking forever and a day on her turns, it might have gone over better with me). The down side is we had a runaway leader problem although he was a much more advanced player than the rest of us (two newbies and one guy who said he's not very good at it); however I found it nearly impossible to get culture, which is VP, and advancing culture advances your VP increase every round. Our runaway leader had a "leader" card which gave him a colony bonus, and a military nobody could assail (by the time you got your military up to his, he built even further so you could just never attack him on your next turn). Twiddling everything every round was annoying (also the "leader" kept moving the wrong pieces; the board is AWFUL for scoring/tracking purposes -- it's straightforward but it's too small and too easy to screw up things that are changing constantly -- having the levels of stuff on your OWN board AND the main board, while redundant, would be my recommendation) And it's basically a tableau builder, which is something I don't mind. The resource mechanic is very, very good in the game... very economical and clever. But, once again, I played a top ten BGG game and found myself asking, "that's what people find so amazing?" I mean, it was adequate and I can't think of anything downright terrible about it, but my socks weren't exactly knocked off.   Second impression knocked it back to a 5; I'll play, but the military stuff makes it into "bash the loser" so if you fall behind you will just get utterly pummeled and continue to fall further behind. And that's really, REALLY stupid for a four hour game (the Full Game rules must recognize this, as resigning is a legal move!). You're basically forced to play a certain way, which sucks out a lot of the fun. Especially since the rest of the game is very good; if military aggressions and wars were waged against some unseen enemy, rather than other players, I'd feel a lot better about this game.  Third impression after lots of plays gets it to a 6. I'll play it but mostly because I'm stubbornly trying to "get it" rather than because I love it. Once you start having a clue what to do it becomes less painful but this is a game you have to really stick with to come to appreciate, and the online version helps a ton with that. I'll never LOVE the take-that, bash-the-weak mechanics, but I at least got decent enough to no longer find them completely crippling.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Canada">Ugh. Tried this with 3 players, but I found it so cumbersome that we stopped after 6 rounds in simple mode. The game is yet another cube pushing worker and resource placement game that is card driven. </comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United Kingdom">Only done a solo runthrough of the intro scenario so far. I'm the king of premature ratings but even I need more time to evaluate.   The main rulebook is a great reference AFTER you've finished the runthrough, probably looks like a hot mess beforehand. Another superb rules job from Vlaada.  There's a lot to take in and I think I'd want at least a couple more sessions before attempting to teach it. But it's very attractive and satisfying to puzzle out. There's a tangible sense of freedom and adventure.   As per FCM and TTA, I fully expect this rating to go up with more plays.  edit: nope. while it certainly works and it's a well put-together beast of a game, its too long and too much effort for the payoff IMO.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="">I'm cooling on this one.  Just so dang fiddly!  If you can get past managing all the little details it is a fun challenge, but that can be a big 'if' at times.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">This hasn't clicked for me like it has for others.  Too many things irritate me.  It is needlessly complex and too text heavy.  AP is heavy and turns are slow because you feel like you have to plan each one optimally, which seriously decreases FPM (Fun Per Minute).  And for goodness sake why do I have to waste all my cool actions just to move somewhere - why can't I just move?!  I like leveling up and exploring, but the rest of the game feels tedious. Hoping it improves on repeat play.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Canada">In short, I was glad that I played the game, I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I am happy that I didn't buy it.   Here is what I didn't like:  - The down-time with four was pretty ridiculous, yes, it was learning game, and yes, this probably goes down with more plays... but still.  - The learning curve was steep. I was glad that somebody else was teaching the game because I would not want that job... so many little details - yes, most of them could be learned when they arose, but I couldn't help frequently asking myself, "what is this or that little detail adding to the game experience... would the game still be good without it?" I'm sure the rules aren't that complex once you get them but you need to be a hard-core gamer to go through the effort and most of my friends don't fit into this category.  - The theme. Actually, to answer one of my questions above, my impression was that many of the complex rules where there to further develop the theme. Indeed, insofar as the thematicness of a game is measured by the beautiful components and rules that directly represent thematic situations, the game is extremely thematic. For me, though, the theme didn't really work on another level - I like my heroes to be defined by some larger concern or struggle, but the heroes in this game are just seeking power. I don't find that thematically interesting. I think I would have enjoyed this kind of system much more had it been applied to a co-op or an accordingly balanced full-out confrontational game.  - This game is multiplayer solitaire with indirect confrontation of the annoying kind. Essentially, you interact with other players only by stealing things from underneath of their noses. My impression is that the game works kind of like this: a lot of your play is determined by circumstances created by other players... however, these players are generally playing to first and foremost further their own self-interest and not to hinder that of others... in most situations, hindering the interests of others is just inconvenient and would pull both the hinderer and the hindered behind everyone else. Thus, when someone effects someone else its because they happened to be in a position where it was possible for them to do this. In other words, the hindered person just got unlucky in a big way, which is't cool in this sort of game.   So, those are my impressions of Mage Knight after a 3+ hour mini-learning game. It probably all sounds rather harsh but I'm just trying to look at it objectively. In fact, I didn't dislike the game and will probably like it more with more plays. However, I would be very surprised if my rating of this game would ever go higher than a 7. </comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">This is a thinking man's version of something akin to Runebound. Very tightly wound, there are a surprising amount of subtle rules to track (e.g. there are many location types and card types in the game) which leads to rules references and complexity. This is to be expected from any elaborate fantasy adventure game. I enjoyed it very much over all, and although it is true there is 'strategy' to the game, it's more a very well done adventure experience. The use of cards is smarter than I expected, but it certainly isn't a deck builder. More like a deck-driven action game. It takes a very long time to play out - which is expected as well, but exhausting. Still, very good game.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Finland">Oh Bloody Chv&#225;til, what have you done again. You have given us a rather simple game with so many layers that it has become very difficult to learn, memorise and teach the rules. It certainly is not a good quality to a game if you have to spend your first plays browsing through the rulebook pondering how everything works. Sure, you can watch the tutorial videos and read the rules and think "OK, now I've got this." But when it is the time to play, you will be facing so many exceptional situations that you just have to check, how it goes again. There is a need for tracking of so many things simultaneously, i.e., you are constantly flipping tokens, pushing tokens, drawing cards, playing cards, rolling dice etc. All this while trying to keep all the restrictions in mind. There are too many things you have to get into your kinetic memory.  Once every single player in the table gets a hang of it, the game becomes a smooth, fast and enjoyable experience. But I literally mean EVERYONE. Should there be even a single player who requires assistance with the rules, the flow is gone.  When it comes to the gameplay, I like the deck building and hand management aspect. It is a brilliant choice for a RPG style boardgame adding more decision making and strategy to the standard action point allocation system. It is also a nice thing that battles are not totally random. However, a hint of uncertainty and push-your-luck elements in the battle would have been nice. Not too random but just a tiny little bit. With a deterministic battle system you know exactly whether you can beat the monster or not. This does not encourage heroic moves against against all odds.   In a nutshell, a fun game and a fun experience. However, I have a sneaking suspicion that Mage Knight is a single use fun. By single I mean that you'll probably play this quite a bit at one time of your life, but after that never again. Re-learning the game will be just too much of an effort for occasional playing, and hence the game will stay in your shelf untouched ever after, no matter how good it was and how fond memories you have of it. But if you have time, investing it in Mage Knight is not a bad choice.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United Kingdom">I feel this is one of those games where your first few actions determine the outcome of the game. If you have a bad start, there really is no-way to recover. Rating could rise with more plays, but I'm not sure if I'll want to play again.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Austria">I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  Gorgeous looking game. Very thematic and epic, but there's too much luck involved for me to like it a lot. I love games with a good amount of luck, when they are quick family/filler games, but I don't want to have too much of it in a deeply strategic game like this.  Still I understand why people love this game so much. I think that for thematic-games players this must be one of the best out there.</comment>

It's not terrible and I see why people like it but I won't be playing again anytime soon. </comment>

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="Finland">Blood Rage sure has cool miniatures (or not). Mounting the minis onto a removable bases of varying colours is also a neat solution to denote the owner of the monster. Rules are rather simple and the game can be started quite quickly.   It is nice that you decide your strategy on the basis of the initial card draft. Thus you can play differently from game to game, sometimes you even have to if you do not get the cards needed for a certain strategy. I also liked that there are two more drafting rounds, when you can make changes to your strategy if needed, or push even further along the path you chose initially.  However, already after the first game everyone in our group felt that we had seen every trick you can pull off during a game, take a few we could not think of. I was not left with an urge to play again to try something different. I take this as a sign of a rather one dimensional game. Yes, the play was fun but it is a shame if you "crack" the code at the first play.  One more thing worth mentioning is the absolutely horrible choice of font. Despite being printed in big and bold the names of the areas are really difficult to read.  The conclusion says that Blood Rage is a nice game but I am afraid it is rather short lived, unless expansions introduce some longevity elements to it.</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">This game has lots of things I like; courtesy of the rubber band effect, it stays close till the end (but I understand why it's annoying to make any inroads before the end only to have them erased and with experienced players, it's just a jockeying for positional bounce). It has area influence/control elements in terms of route building and pricing of the locations. The nuance of the auction in terms of both bidding and nominating is fantastic. It's a game that rewards those who understand how to ride (and abuse) the turn order system, and can do long budgeting (much more so than other auction/econ games). I generally enjoy playing it, but I just don't get jazzed about the game; I don't request it, and I admit, I'll sort of think of whether I want to dedicate that sort of time to it if asked. It's a game where if someone said "you have 4 hours, would you rather play 1 game of Indonesia or 2 of Power Grid" I'd say Indonesia hands down, but if I only have 90-120 minutes, then I'd consider Power Grid. It fits in that smaller time frame.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">Great game though it's been pretty well eclipsed by Indonesia in my game group.  A bit too mathy.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United Kingdom">I like the slow build of tension in this game and was really fond of it for the longest time, yet these days I wish it could be accelerated somehow or that there was more going on. Its strength is its weakness; the simple cycle of auction, buy, build wears on me after 8-10 iterations. A solid game but these days there are so many I'd choose first.   Will keep an eye on the card game that's in the works...</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">Solid German game. I think the theme is better connected to the mechanics than Puerto Rico. Though I can't ever imagine myself saying "why doesn't someone make a game on buying power plants and the rights to power up cities", this game works and works pretty well if you're into the theme. There's great tension in the bidding process and the ever-changing available power plants. The map boards seem to create interesting dilemmas of position and placement. Overall, the game pieces are deluxe and nicely done with one exception: why the rules aren't in color is beyond me. I do have a creative design critique: why make the different types of wooden goods in strange shapes as non-cubes tend to roll around. I would have been satisfied with just different colored cubes but I'm more of a "functional gamer." I disagree with some reviewers with their belief that it's too mathematical as one can play most of this game without decisions being bogged down in equations. The very end-game (last couple of turns) can get math-heavy but the decisions are few at this point. It is an economic game with a focus on using your cash wisely and that's not going to appeal to everybody. This one should see plenty of play in our gaming group.   Update: Lowering my rating from 8.5 to 6.5. I was wrong as the game is too math heavy for my taste. To play it well, you have to be planning at least a full turn ahead and calculate your money down to the last dollar. It has a run-away leader problem as there's very little you can do (without destroying yourself) to reign someone in if they get lucky in auctions. The auction mechanism can unbalance the game. Players may over pay for what are visible plants only to see a fresh plant pop up late in a turn that gives the loser of earlier auctions a golden opportunity (broken auction mechanism to me). It's also better to place later on the board for starting positions as there's no where to hide without hurting yourself and it's better to respond to player's positions than to try and stake one out. And how many auction games does the world need?</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Canada">The 9 turn limit seemed completely arbitrary, the game ended right as it was getting going - giving it an engine game feel over an awesome space saga feel.

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">This really is a fantastic game!  It's an easy 9 after several games played.  Presently, the only thing keeping it from being a 10 for me is that if you do poorly in the early game, you can end up just being along for the ride for a couple hours with no hope of victory.  Maybe this impression will change as I get better with the game, though.  Update: I really, really want to enjoy the game.  Seriously, it drives me crazy, but I just don't think I do.  The issue I mentioned in my early impressions hasn't cleared up.  It feels like fairly early in the game, several people will be effectively eliminated, leaving the major players to fight it out.  These quasi-eliminated players don't really have fun for the rest of the game, and I just can't rate a game highly when several players won't enjoy it every game.  I want to love Eclipse, but I just can't.</comment>

It's tempting to give precise clues for 1 card as if slow and steady wins the day - and often enough, the game reduces to just this. But with a bit of stretching, you can get more than 1 clue done. And better, you can mentally file away past clues to surge ahead later. Certainly approachable. Good for a group of 4+. Will I put it into my collection? Hmm. Difficult to say.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">08-12-14: This one is a good game, but a bit of a letdown. I bought into the BGG hype but the game itself felt much more like hard work than a game (i.e. FUN). And by hard work, I don't mean the hard but rewarding kind, but more of the boring, tedious kind. I'd give it another shot.  UPDATED 4-27-15: After having played two other Ignacy games since first playing this game a year ago, I think the quote above "the game itself felt much more like hard work than a game" could apply to all of them. Witcher I have no desire to play again, at all. Imperial Settlers I'll try again, but with only 2 players. Robinson Crusoe feels like I'm doing my taxes, but at least when I do my taxes I have the reward of receiving a refund a few weeks later.</comment>

I would say that it is very similar to Shadowrift overall. I doubt that this will be a keeper for me...</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Excellent co-op. Feels very thematic, invites loads of discussion around the table and is exceedingly challenging. It is a sandbox game for sure (with sand!). My only concern now is the difficulty. Is it even possible to defeat this game? The first scenario, maybe so. But the others? No way unless the cards fall exactly right and the dice do not betray you. Some might enjoy the brutality, but I find I give up after a few crushing defeats. It feels like the game shouts a playground dare - one that I am just not willing to take up too often.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Finland">2014-09-15 I've got really mixed feelings over this one. The theme can't get much better, but somehow the cluttered set of rules stand in the way of immersion. Instead of pondering what's best for survival, you spend your time trying to figure out how the book keeping works and what is written on all the cards. Furthermore, there are certain actions that are absolute necessities, but why make execution of those actions too complicated. Take hunting for an example. Thematically it makes sense, that you first have to track down the animals before hunting them down. But for gameplay, it just makes it too complicated.   I guess Robinson Crusoe will get better after half a dozen of games under your belt, but considering its length, I just do not see myself playing often enough.  Here is my tip for all you designers out there making thematic games. Keep the rules fairly simple and ask yourself whether you could streamline the rules so that things are accomplished with single actions instead of small incremental ones. Ask the play testers, whether they actually felt like being in the game instead of trying to figure out, in which order to perform things.  Robinson Crusoe is by no means broken, and I could play again. It is just a bit too fiddly for my taste of thematic co-ops. But at least it's better than Castaways, which is a half finished product compared to this one.  2016-11-23 I have to add that this game can be ridiculously hard to the point that it is not enjoyable anymore. I love challenges and I do not mind losing. However, I do want to feel that, despite failing in the end, I gave a valiant effort and made some progress at least.   My experiences with Crusoe have sometimes been quite far from this. Whatever improvements or progress we have made has been immediately snatched away by random events. You build a shovel only for it to break. You build a fire only for rain to quench it. You find food only for you to swallow your own tongue. Then halfway through the game you realise that it is mathematically impossible for you to win anymore even if bad things stopped. And this can happen even if you play a perfect game. It just seems that it takes more to beat a perfect storm. Thus I have come to suspect you have to have all the stars align on the first couple of rounds to even have a slightest of chance of winning. If this is really true, it certainly is not a good thing that a 2-3 hour game is decided during the first 20 minutes but you still have play it till the bitter end.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">+Highly thematic. +Gives players lots of freedom to work together in a meaningful way. +The game responds to what the players do through event cards geared towards the actions the players take. +Multiple scenarios offer numerous ways to play and keep the game fresh.  The designer has already released a new print-and-play scenario free of charge! +Lots and lots of events and treasures mean you will very rarely see the same ones pop up.  =Some "interesting" translations on some cards and other components.  Usually these aren't enough to make the cards/components unplayable. =There are a lot of little rules to remember in this game, which means it's easy to not play entirely correctly. =This game is VERY hard.  I haven't yet decided if it's TOO hard, but it's close.  I don't mind games with a steep learning curve, but I'm concerned this one is simply designed to make even the best players lose more often than not.  With shorter games, I don't mind losing fairly often because I have time to try again, but with a longer game like this one, I'd at least like to have a 50/50 chance of winning with competent play.  -The game feels highly chaotic and random.  Winning seems more about luck than good strategy. -The rulebook is terrible.  Very poor translation with lots of grammatical errors and typos.  I can understand problems with translation, but how hard is it to catch "Ilsand"? -Even ignoring translation issues, the rules are still lacking important details and are not well laid out. -There are only 4 player roles in the game, and 1 of them is only supposed to be used for 4 players.  The rest of the game has a lot of variety, but it seems they skimped on perhaps the most important part for adding to replayability. -The tokens are not the best quality.  They are rather thin.  UPDATE 8/23/14: Recently received the Z-man version of the game as a gift.  While the tokens are much improved in this version, the grammar errors and rulebook readability are not.  I can't tell if Z-man had a proofreader look at the game, but if they did, the person did a poor job.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="">Sigh.  I like the theme and some of the system, but worker placement is dull even co-op.  I'd play Yggdrasil any day.  Less work, more fun, and possibly more "interest" -- RC has enough randomness that planning can fail badly without much casual chain to make you feel ok.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Sweden">Very nice co-op game. I like the fact that you decide your actions as a group and not as individuals, that makes it easier to feel that you are working together and also makes it less likely to be played by a single player telling the others what to do. Everyone can ship in with ideas, based on the open information. I also like the event-deck mechanic &#225; la Pandemic and Forbidden Island, it fits together very well. </comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Sweden">It's a co-op... It may be a very good co-op but everyone is playing together and it could just as well just be one person playing.  Nice mechanics and stories but still just a co-op.  And a co-op isn't all that interesting. May be very good for being one though :)</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="">I've played it twice, I think, and both times our group died before having seem to have even really done anything. I'm not sure if we were playing hard scenarios or got unlucky, or what, but it felt like a decent game engine, tuned to insane mode as the default. I'd think that this was a fluke or a rule played wrong, but I think I've heard people talking about how many times they had to play, just to succeed once.  Possibly best as a solo game. Anything else and you're screwed. Or, look for a variant that makes it easier.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Wow. It is far from a perfect game, but this has a wealth of variability, and immersive magic.   More in the near.   *Edit: dropped from 9 to 6. Why? The rules are a mess. The system lost its engaging quality, and feels like a kludgy collection of ad hoc justifications.   The immersive magic evaporated after playing through the possibility space more. </comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Sweden">Initial game experience; Negative. It seems boring and puzzle like. Will try it a few more times before I throw it away or sell it.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United Kingdom">Rating based on 1 play. Great game - an amazing creation.  Brain-burner too. But wow it takes a long time.  It took us 4 hours to play.  Too long for me really.  On reflection I'm not sure I'd ever choose to play again if I had other games to choose from. Downgraded to a 6.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="">My rating is based on a single play. We were four players, one really hated the game and that spoiled the mood. But the game has interesting mechanic, but is confusing for new payers. I'll have to lpay again and reexamine my rating.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">Wow! This game did my head in. Do not start it late at night if you have never played... but what a game! The fact that VPs and money are separate in this game is pretty n neat (relative to Age of Steam... come on you fiends!). The differences between the various eras is wild too. I made a number of mistakes in my initial play, but loved the challenge. I think Martin Wallace has another winner on his hands. It is no Age of Steam, but it is an interesting and unique challenge. I'm curious to know what I will think once I can actually play this one with some level of competency.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">Not my thing after 1 play. Need to play more.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United Kingdom">Just can't quite like this over Age of Industry. Dislike the fact that you always regenerate cards and thus is a fixed number of turns and sometimes the location cards are just too restrictive and can often leave you with very few places to build.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United Kingdom">I like the mechanic that means buildings only score if they have been used but there are billions of exceptions to the rest of the rules which makes it feel very klunky. I'll definitely play it again, hopefully soon before I forget all the rules.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="">Very dry and very long. I am willing to play it again though..</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United Kingdom">Really went off this game.  I absolutely love the mechanics and the feeling of construction as time goes on.  But I absolutely hate hate hate the feeding mechanic - I play games to have fun, not to be punished by the unrelenting system. This is also the reason I'm lukewarm on Agricola. It just feels like a cheap mechanic.  I also loathe that the same sets of cards come out in the same order every time. This is where Agricola excels, but Le Havre sucks.   </comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Played twice, still struggle finding a good strategy (or *any* strategy).</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United Kingdom">Waiting to find players who know it better, seems too easy for experienced players to win.  Edit: gave up waiting with my copy.  The game presents a big problem for me, there appear to be multiple paths to victory but different strategies have different inherent values which make some clearly better than others, but only if you notice it. I find it very one-dimensional if people have to ignore many of the differing paths to focus on the most lucrative.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Like Agricola but more complex.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Not sure of the version I have but it is English and includes Le Havre: Le Grand Hameau in the box.  The components are in great condition and I've put all the chits in a Plano style container.  The only thing wrong is there is a dent and crease in the top box cover on the right side along the edge.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Poland">I love how the rules are really simple but the game play is deep. On the other hand it should last at least two times shorter. On top of that last turns just overflows with resources and points counting which makes it even longer. Last but not least replayability seem quiete low for such a long game as number of good strategies is very low.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Australia">Not at all a bad game.  I just don't particularly want to ever play it again.  Whatever itches it might scratch are dominated for me by other games.  Update: better with another play, but I'd still prefer to play most of the usual suspects over this one.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="">One of those Eurogames which are undeniably tight concerning gameplay, but with a theme so boring I'd like placing it beside my bed to sleep better at night. Additionally, the game takes too long for my taste.   Theme (artwork/story/...) 0.5/2 Gameplay (smooth play/player interaction/strategy&amp;tactics/depth) 4/5 Fun factor (can you afford a smile during play?) 1.5/3  </comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Cool, although nothing special.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United Kingdom">Terraforming Mars does have excellent fidelity to its theme; players are rewarded for warming and oxygenating the environment, and for placing lakes.    These activities also act as a clock, with the game ending when the planet is inhabitable.  There are alternative strategies around mining, settlement building, power generation and the greening of the planet.   The game's engine is tableau building and as tableau builders tend to be, it is pretty solitairish.  Interaction is limited to some minor take thatery.  Stop blubbing, it is minor.  As with other turn-based tableau builders, there is quite a lot of downtime.  In the one game I have played it seemed as though money just wasn't tight enough and the end game really dragged as those capable of raising the temperature instead chased the leader.  The hex map of the surface of Mars serves little purpose beyond corralling the players' developments.  The artwork has come in for some criticism; it is somewhat uneven.  Production quality is decent.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="">I love the theme of this game, the emphasis on raising the temperature and oxygen levels, and the forest, ocean and city building.  I give these elements a 9 of 10.   I also appreciate the "labor of love" feel of this game, crafting (and presumably balancing) all the cards, etc.     Having said that, for my gamer tastes, Terraforming Mars did not provide a particularly interesting or compelling gaming experience.  Virtually the entire game consisted of collecting and playing cards within the confines of my private player tableau.  Then, after we had built up our huge collections of cards, the game ended, and we tallied up the points.  During our game, the other players showed virtually no interest in my cards, and likewise, I showed no interest in their cards.  All in all, Terraforming Mars felt like it was about 95% multiplayer solitaire.  Admittedly, there are a lot of cards to read and think about, and as such, there are a lot of card combinations to ponder and potentially test out in future plays.  So, yes, if you like card combo games with lots of re-ployability, this could be a good game for you.  Unfortunately, I am not a card combo gamer, and I prefer much more player interaction in my games.  Having little interest in playing the game again, have to give it a 6.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Germany">Rating is for 2 player game only.  The game is fun but the endgame really drags with 2 players as it does not seem that the perceived leader can be caught up to. This leads to a weird, lopsided 'excitement against time' progression. Terraforming Mars is very intriguing and fun in the first couple of generations but gets less and less interesting the more global factors have been closed off, as many parts of your engine became more or less useless.  Probably a better (and shorter) game with 3 or more players</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">10/22/16:  Reminds me of Hansa Teutonica or Suburbria.  Very tactical on first play and the last third feels a little processional.  It might start feeling more strategic with more plays.  Not sure how long this will stay interesting.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Germany">I like they basic concept of terraforming a planet together. The shared parameters of O2 and temprature is a neat idea and adds to the feeling. Card drafting + building is something I always like in games.  Many paths appear to be narrow though and the actual tile laying at the map appears to be a bit disconnected to the rest of the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Take a good game with shitty graphic design, then throw in a smattering of cards that force you to pick a specific opponent to screw over... Yeah. I could take it or leave it.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Poland">Played it once, a 3-player game. We felt it was an ok game, yet it overstayed its welcome. We played the shorter variant with advanced corporations, no drafting. So almost the simplest game, apart from the corporations and the initial purchasing of cards (which we did). Yeah... my fears about limited interaction turned out to be right. There's a big emphasis on your own engine optimization. There *is* interaction though, and it potentially may be significant with more experienced players: on the map, fights for milestones, awards or final opportunities for terraforming. We just felt that most of the time we weren't really interested in what cubes other players pushed left and right on their player boards. Interaction came close to the end. However the game lasted more than 2 hours, so we were a bit tired towards the end. Then we felt like there was a luck of draw. Could be fixed by the official drafting variant, but at the same time the game would drag even longer. Overall we think there are better games with limited interaction that we can play in shorter time, which we enjoy more at the same time: The Castles of Burgundy, Bruges and Suburbia came to our minds, they kind of scratch the same itch for us (although imo Suburbia has nice level of interaction, but it has that tableau building thing). With that said, it's a decent game, but there are so many better ones, so it's up for trade.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Spain">The worst part of the game is that's reeeeaaaally ugly!! Beside of this, I didn't enjoy much the resource management, area control phase, and the whole theme... it seems cold for me and the mechanics doesn't bring me nothing special.  Played once</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Germany">Irgendwie kann ich den Hype um das Spiel nicht verstehen. Es dauert einfach zu lange f&#252;r das, was es bietet.Freilich kann man immer etwas machen, aber es entsteht kein Mangel im Spiel und je nach Aufkommen der Karten und Entscheidungsfreude der Mitspieler kann es z&#228;h werden wie ein Kaugummi.

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Excellent components and artwork. Game itself is meh to good. Just another take on worker placement, which I'm getting pretty tired of.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Germany">Der Zahnradmechanismus ist sch&#246;n. Aber leider verl&#228;sst sich das Spiel zu sehr darauf und verschenkt anderweitig sein Potenzial.  Z.B. die Geb&#228;ude und Monumente, die man baut, haben weder Bilder noch Namen, sind einfach lieblos gestaltete Siegpunktpl&#228;ttchen. Zudem spielen sie im Spiel keine weitere Rolle, bringen weder Vorteile, noch spielt die Anzahl/Kombination der Geb&#228;ude irgendeine Rolle. Somit geht zum einen der thematische Anstrich verloren, zum anderen ist es vom Spielgef&#252;hl her trocken, nur ein reines Siegpunkt sammeln anstatt etwas aufzubauen.  Ein weiterer Punkt ist, dass man gezwungen ist, sich, auf einen bestimmten Siegpunktpfad festzulegen, und dann ist der Rest des Spiel nur noch Rechnerei, um hier und da noch einen Punkt mehr rauszuholen. Das f&#252;hrt gegen Ende zu Gr&#252;belorgien. Es fehlt zudem auch an Spieldynamik und Flexibilit&#228;t.  Wirklich schade um den tollen Zahnradmechanismus, das h&#228;tte so leicht ein echter Kracher werden k&#246;nnen.  F&#252;r die ersten 1-2 Partien ist es trotzdem spannend, um den Zahnradmechanismus mal auszuprobieren, doch der schlecht konzipierte Rest verdirbt den Wiederspielreiz.  So ist es leider ein Blender, faszinierend auf den ersten Blick, doch dann wird man ern&#252;chtert.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Too many tempting paths to victory, not all of which synergize.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Wales">There isn't anything very new here, except for the cog-turning, which isn't really a new mechanic - just a different presentation of things we've seen before in games like Village - i.e. workers increase their yield the longer they take over their task. The multiple routes to victory, buildings with production costs, and differing victory point generators, all feel like they were pulled straight from Ninjato, or Stone Age, or Walnut Grove, or any of a list of other worker placement games. It's quite a heavy implementation of the genre, and that might appeal to some - certainly heavier than all the afore-mentioned titles (except arguably Village). It looks great, but the theme doesn't really come through. All in all, it's an interesting resource-conversion, multi-player solitaire, puzzle, but there are many other choices if you want a game in this mould.  After a second play, I am even more disappointed in this game. It's a straight-up resource-conversion exercise, with no thematic integration at all. I convert grain into wood, to advance a step in an unspecified technology, which gives me additional wood, allowing me to build an un-named, un-illustrated "building", which gives me more grain. Rinse and repeat. I like dry, relatively themeless Euros, but this really is one step too far, and actually feels a little boring. The vast number of interconnected resources and action-spaces feel indulgent, and the whole thing is unwieldy - similar to another over-hyped, flabby, recent title, Bora Bora.   I have met many people who like this game, so there is clearly fun to be had here, and I won't turn down future games, but I won't be seeking it out.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="">Yeah, it's alright like</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Good game, though I'm terrible at it.  Gears are a gimmick, but a good gimmick so I can't complain.  Strategy is pretty much a black box unfortunately, and there's not much in my brain to deal with remembering the standard opening moves and how best to counter them.  I don't really like it enough to buy it, but I'll play it every so often when it gets brought.  The group hasn't brought it much though.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Netherlands">The first time you play it, its exciting but you realize there is not much game in here. The 2nd (because probably you will lose the first time) is not so exciting any more. The third feels like a chore. You just want to finish it and move on.   And that is all you are getting in this box. 3-4 plays out of which only the 1st is something to talk about.  Of course you can buy expansions, but it seems like the base game has the best story so I don't feel like investing further...</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Canada">Like: the artwork, the participatory nature of the game, the discussion, the reveal.

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Belgium">The mechanics are slick, but running through the same story several times was a killer for me.  I will roleplay instead of playing this game any day.</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Australia">An interesting mix between RPG lite and a co-op style of make-your-own-adventure book with players acting as time travellers, inhabiting the bodies of various characters - akin to Avatar.    Players must work together to explore various locations, occasionally interacting with NPCs and areas to find items that help solve the various puzzles, trying to best utilise their skills and overcoming deficiencies, all within time-track mechanism.    The artwork is evocative and compelling and the production quality is fantastic (as expected from Space Cowboys) but the constant stopping to read and paraphrase text detracts from the pace of the game.  There are also differences between the rules provided and the latest ones available on-line - pointing toward a lack of robust testing.  With each time run more information is gleaned that progresses the narrative, but each subsequent run devolves into a memory exercise, trying to recall what you did on the previous run to optimise your efforts within the available time.  Unfortunately each scenario is also a once-thru and some of the terminology doesn't quite gel (differences in translation, perhaps).    One piece of advice - take notes!  An modestly enjoyable gaming experience - but overall, it falls slightly short of being the deeply immersive experience I was hoping for.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Australia">Quite good fun.   You'll feel pretty satisfied on solving the adventure that comes in the box..</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Belgium">1 player? play a point &amp; click on your computer.  2 players, you play 2 roles, meh at best.  Didn't try with 3 or more, I suppose it is where it shines best but not in love with the concept of starting over with more known info until I make a good or even the perfect run.  Not even starting on price and needed extensions to replay it as it is sold as an "experience". I already grew allergic to (most) expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United Kingdom">Difficult but a cleverly designed game. The first try was interesting and quite enjoyable, but subsequent tries felt more like a memory test and were somewhat tedious. Replayability is zero. I am glad I played it but unlikely to play again.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="England">A really nice idea squandered by a few weird mechanics. I love the idea of having those beautiful, thematic panoramic views of rooms behind which there are certain bits of info and things to do. I don't even mind the limited-use scenarios either (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is God-tier). However, it's a shame that with all of the past and future to choose from they opted for two of the most overused settings in fiction history: zombies and mental asylums. Aside from these gripes, I'd be happy to play it when the group want to.</comment>

    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">I have come to accept that I really don't like cooperative games that much.  That being said, this is a good one. It may be a bit more complicated than it needs to be, but it has a nice mix of mechanics.   The crossroads cards can seem to be unneccessary at times, but they really add a nice thematic element. The challenges are not as interesting as they could be, but they definitely add challenge. Balancing characters is important and adds a nice twist.  I enjoyed playing, which is novel for coops. I would play it again.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="">Repetitive, dragged on.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United Kingdom">Might be an issue of slow players but after half a dozen plays this felt far too long for what it offered. I still like the Crossroads cards and the everyone-looks-suspect quality but there really isn't much to actually do in the game. Search or kill? Rinse and repeat.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="Canada">Played once and I don't think I like it. It was repetitive and way way too long. Also, I get nothing out of betrayer mechanics as they tend to just destroy the actual game for me. If it has to be betrayer-mechanics, I'd rather it was pure betrayer mechanics like in Avalon.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Best zombie game out there. Unfortunately, that's not saying much..</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">We played a partial 3-player game. I got a good feel for how the game runs, but not how it finishes. It was selling well throughout GenCon and I do expect it sold out. It plays very smooth and is very simple to run - which I appreciate alot. The theme is spectacular indeed. I love the look and feel here - a wintery apocalypse is richly thematic and evokes the tension needed for this type of co-op. I like the idea of possible betrayal in your own ranks - everybody gets a secret objective. The general play is everyone rolls dice and then goes out exploring locations by drawing up cards. Want more selection? Draw more cards - but that risks attracting more zombies. And why draw cards? To complete the crisis happening each round as well as beef up your characters.  The main touted feature here are the crossroads card. Conceptually, these are brilliant. Your neighbor draws one of these cards and if the event listed occurs during your turn, they read to you the results and you pick which happens. But I have a few problems with this. First, of the cards we drew, ALL but one of them pertained to specific characters in the game. Only once was the character in the game - so they didn't get triggered. When one did get triggered, it pertained to one of my characters - and it wasn't my turn. I was *reading* the card. Very strange feeling to have your character's decision determined by another player. It didn't feel thematic - just clumsy somehow. Another one was a set up of a fight in the colony - but we only had a single character there so it made no sense. Second, the consequence of the decision is revealed to the player - which feels very odd in play. I'd rather know the choices, but not the consequences. This all made me feel the crossroad cards were a missed opportunity.   That plus the rather repetitive play experience (search search search) left me a bit unimpressed. Don't take this for not enjoying the game - because I did and would gladly play again. But I didn't feel the need to buy it.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Single game play.  My role was as the betrayer with the secret objective being to have 5 survivors killed.  I waited until the time in which I had consecutive turns and quite easily sabotaged the group in a single turn and won.    The gameplay in general I though was quite fun, but as the betrayer I thought it was a bit easy to make the game go the hell very quickly.   12/2014 - After playing 3 times I really just don't see the appeal of this.  </comment>

O fato dele copiar as principais mec&#226;nicas de BSG (enfrentar crise, vota&#231;&#227;o secreta, traidor no grupo) foi algo que me desagradou, mas achei o n&#237;vel de dificuldade bem condizente com a proposta do jogo (sobreviver ao apocalipse zumbi no meio de uma nevasca). O fato de n&#227;o ter elimina&#231;&#227;o de jogadores tamb&#233;m foi algo que gostei e a ideia do exilado (uma c&#243;pia da cadeia em BSG) &#233; algo interessante porque o jogador ainda participa, mas de uma forma diferente.

    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">1st play: Learning games like this can always be a little rough. I liked it more than most zombie games, with the hidden secret objectives and the story elements in the crossroads cards. The traitor element felt weird, but it was mechanically necessary as the game was pretty easy without that.  No 2nd play: Zombies aren't my thing. This is better than most but still not amazing.</comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Finland">Down from 8 to 6. A fine game, but I've lost my interest in playing it. In the long run the fairly low replay value, long play time and WP player screwage are weighing it down.   Caylus is a brilliant design that epitomises the worker placement genre. At first glance it appears overwhelmingly complex, but there is a method to the madness and learning the mechanics and strategies is an interesting challenge. Once you do that, though, the game becomes an increasingly tedious and repetitive analysis-paralysis excercise.  Like most WP games, the main interaction comes from blocking other players and making mistakes is very costly. Caylus also has many mechanics that punish you for mistakes and by which the other players may screw you over. This can be very frustrating and causes serious AP issues as players try to calculate everything and avoid making a mistake while trying their best to calculate what others might be doing and how to wreck their plans.   The game is very long (too long!) and playing it makes me feel like I just ran a marathon. It is challenging and interesting in a masochistic way. The game experience is highly frustrating and the only times the suffering feels justified is when you win.   The iPhone app version is very well done. It has nice graphics and cuts the play time and bookkeeping down nicely. It still feels just as fiendishly frustrating to play as the original. Worth the money for everyone who enjoys the game. </comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="England">Bought it, played it, sold it. A perfectly reasonable game but its array of mechanics and game length meant that Caylus was for gamers only and mostly going to sit on the shelf. Removing one mechanism (if that were possible) might produce more focused gameplay. I'll happily play other people's copies.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Netherlands">Too boring for me. It's completely dry and very chess-like (perfect information game and apart from the player order at the start, completely luck-free). I guess if you are interested in calculating a lot of things, you may like it but it's too complex for me to be entertaining.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">I think it's a good game but my lower rating is based on the ruthless backstabbing that can occur. Just not my game group's style.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">I was really disappointed in this one. I did not like the randomness of the bag pulls (and I have come to like Hyperborea). I generally despise strategy games that use random event decks. If you fall behind early in one of the tracks, it can be a long game just to finish out the stretch in what you know is a losing game.  I can also see this feeling very samey after just a few plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Scotland">This one could go up.  Intrigued but not entirely sold yet.  Would definitely play again.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">4 plays / 4,5 players  LIKE: Even though it's just another efficiency race game, there is lots to explore. The multitude of strategies is very fun and the main point of the game. Gameplay was smooth. Nice thick tokens (TMG version). DISLIKE: Money wasn't tight, so the events seemed pointless. Goods gained weren't used for anything but points, so that felt bland. Lacks player interaction at times. Rules weren't complete, felt they left some questions unanswered.  OVERALL: I am surprised this is rated as high as it is. I do like it because of the sheer amount of strategies to pursue, but the lack of tension in the game gave it a somewhat mild aftertaste. I am eager to try a variant to make the events stronger.  </comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Finland">Orl&#233;ans is a quite nice engine building game. You start with limited possibilities but continuously expand your horizons. I especially enjoyed that the game rewards long term strategies, i.e., at the start you choose the way you want to go and push it all the way through. This is really nice since you can make a great master plan, and then just try to execute it.  It seems that most strategies are more or less equally competitive meaning that the outcome will be decided on the tactical level. You need to phase your actions so that you always get what you need at the right time. Some strategies involve more direct competition with the opponents while others allow for you to fondle your own stuff mostly. This might be an issue especially with four players if three decide to race against each other while the fourth player can proceed at a pace of his own.  At first, you might think that the game would be awfully long with 18 full rounds. However, the 90 minutes playing time is actually quite true provided that everyone allocates their workers on action spaces simultaneously. I really think this is the only valid way to play, since 18 rounds would just be too long if everyone pondered every single move for a few minutes. The setup is a bit long, though.  One decision I did not fancy, though, was that all extra buildings are available right from the start. This creates an unnecessary vast decision tree and leaves novices and beginner level players flabbergasted. Moreover, it is easy to think of a tight game with experts who want to analyze everything very carefully and thus freezing the game due to too many options available.  In a nutshell, I enjoyed Orl&#233;ans but there is nothing exceptional to it. There are some (minor) issues with the vastness of the decision tree but you can adopt a strategy which allows you to take a more straightforward approach and ignore the tree completely.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Poland">I had high expactations for this game. It turns out it's ok game but not great. There is no player interaction and it plays like solitaire.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">Bag builder.  Enjoyable but feels like path to victory comes down to scholar track and building settlements.  Events not punitive enough to deter this strategy.  </comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Poland">I liked the idea of the bag building mechanism, and even enjoyed the game for some time. However I do have a couple of issues with the game. First of all it overstayed its welcome. Everybody said it played a bit too long (2h with 3 players). 18 rounds turned out to be too long. At the beginning of the game you have many options, but can only do 1-2 actions a rounds. Later in the game you have a lot of capabilities, but a number of actions diminishes, which is irritating. On the other hand if it weren't for this aspect interaction would be even scarcer. And this smoothly leads us to the second problem. This is mainly a multiplayer solitaire. Hardly ever do you interact with other players. The map where you wander with your merchant is so big that all 3 players easily maneuvered over there. Only by the end of the game did we look at the Town's Hall to see whether somebody is about to snatch the citizen of the auxiliary board. Overall, I like euro games and indirect interaction, but this one lacked interaction even for my taste.  Overall, it was an ok game, but there are small chances it will hit the table again, there are simply better picks for this time span. I have just put it on our local Polish MathTrade. </comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United Kingdom">Decent enough dice placement game held up by the interesting asymmetric player powers. The game actions boil down to get resources, travel, complete contracts - would've liked a bit more breadth. And a personal pet peeve is the character that gets to choose his die rolls - boring!!</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Germany">I didn't like playing this much. Other people urged me to give it another chance, but nowadays there are enough other similar dice-based games that I could try instead.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Finland">The Voyages of Marco Polo will definitely appeal to everyone who like their nuts to be tough to crack. By this I mean that in the the game you experience an acute shortage of everything. You are always one resource, money or action short from executing all what you want. And this is not only at the end of the game, the pressure is constant. As a gaming experience this pressure translates to an unforgiving optimisation exercise of the use of resources and actions. You simply cannot afford to waste anything if you want to have that sensation of accomplishment. Should your steps stray from the optimal path you quickly find yourself in a deadlock from where there is no escape.   When it comes to other aspects of the game, I find it quite interesting. Dice as workers to place is a nice mechanic and forces you to adapt to a degree since you cannot plan everything ahead. But the best thing in my opinion are the strong special powers each character and city grants. They really seem to make a difference. This creates myriad of valid strategies which, from what I've experienced and heard, are quite well balanced. This is truly a great achievement. So many ways to play, so many ways to win, you just have to find your own niche where there is less competition. However, the strong powers also add to the need for heavy optimisation. One cannot forgo their powers, since generalists who do a little bit of everything will not excel. To make the best use of your powers you have direct your scarce resources on a single goal, while pessimised moves gain you nothing, absolutely nothing.  Marco Polo has a steep learning curve and provides a subject to study for a long time. I like puzzles and I like tough games. But I reckon The Voyages of Marco Polo might be best played online, although not in a live match. This is simply because the ruthlessness of the game does not reward casual play. Personally, I do not enjoy sloppy plays, but at the same time, I do not like being the person who is APing in the table. Similarly, I detest sitting in a table where one or several players are  not even trying to win or freeze all the time (admittedly I am often guilty of paralysing myself, so it won't be me throwing the first rock and thus I am not complaining too much).   A game that is has a very similar feel and tickles the same cell in your brains is Terra Mystica, IMHO.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">With all due respect to the fans, I can't understand how this game is rated so highly.  Yes, it has _really_ good mechanisms (with one flaw IMHO) and offers diverse strategies, however all but one (or possibly two) of those strategies are _entirely_ pointless.  I can even overlook the fact that the character powers are significantly unbalanced, but what I can't overlook is that you can't compete (or even stay remotely close) unless you play primarily and heavily towards contracts - with one possible exception - and, to me, that makes for a pointless game.  As much as I liked the mechanisms, I'm in no hurry to play this again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">"A story with Lovecraftian elements, not a Lovecraftian story" is rather apt, as is a comparison to Indiana Jones in that it's less horror and more worldly romp. I'm not after a game that is specifically an Arkham game, so much as that thematic universe. To that end, this fits marvelously well. Yes, you throw dice constantly (and it's that unfortunate form of "decide first, random after"), but thats not the point. Eldritch Horror is an interesting exploration game with a decent narrative and story (which was my driving factor); one where an actress go to the gym to work out (increase strength rolls) and then buy a double barreled shotgun to eradicate monsters and close gates or we're headed toward victory and then my partner's dark pact comes due, and she turns and stabs me (a reformed cultist) and feeds me to the monsters while she romps off to (a shared) victory. Somewhat group dependent; I didn't particularly feel there was much down time, but I valued the story that was created (even if it wasn't necessarily similar to the stories, ymmv). We read encounters to each other, only reading the bits that were relevant to tell the story and getting into character when possible. Music, lighting, and people getting into it is what really drives EH. To that end, it needs the first expansion to break up the limited cycling of cards (which really hurts the narrative aspect).   Overall, no regrets, even if it's not something I'd want to play constantly. In some ways, Mansions of Madness (2nd edition in particular) scratches a similar itch, but it's different. Comparatively, EH is less thematic in it's presentation and representation, includes less tension or intimacy with it's subject, but has the potential to be much more emergent than MoM2e does with it's limited (and driven) scenario count. Eldritch Horror has the serious potential to go the distance for tons of plays, where as MoM2e doesn't.  One of my strongest 6s/weakest 7s.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">I've only played a couple of rounds but it feels very similar to Arkham, though I am by no means an expert. If you like Arham you will like this game, and if you don't, then you probably won't like this one either.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">I am not always a big fan of random luck in dice but the way this game works made it fun.

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">It streamlines Arkham, but it also loses most of it's predecessor's charm.   When I say streamlined, I don't necessarily mean shorter play time. </comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Finland">Eldritch Horror was introduced to me as streamlined Arkham Horror which would've been great, since I like playing the latter one, but due to the enormous amount of time needed for the setup and moving the pieces around, I seldom get a chance.   Well, Eldritch Horror wasn't exactly what I expected. Setup was still quite a chore and the game didn't move all that fast. Or should I say that the game ended fast in terms of completed rounds, but the absolute time it took was quite long. I found it quite disappointing to see that I only managed to move from Panama to New York and then to San Francisco during the 3,5 hours. Oh, I loved the story, and actually celebrated when my character died, but I wanted to do more than just to collect two clues, buy a train ticket, get ambushed by a monster, get stabbed into forehead and wake up in a unfamiliar ditch without a recollection of the events night before.  In a nutshell, the story was enjoyable but I didn't feel that I actually contributed to the outcome of the game in any significant way. The proportion of story telling and book keeping to actual playing is way off its mark here. I would play again but I would never consider buying the game knowing that it wouldn't actually get any table time. Should I have a suitable slot in my calendar, Arkham Horror would be my pick, since it has almost the same playing time but you get to do more. </comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">This was a fun co-op, and I think with more plays it will go up in rating.  We lost all at once in the end, mostly due to not understanding the flow of the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="">Arkham Horror, but improved. I think. Still deciding, but I am finding it at least a bit more engaging than Arkham. Might just be that the game is new, though.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Greece">Another adventure game set in the world of Lovecraft. I liked the quality components and the cool artwork. The condition mechanic is a clever idea and works great.  Gameplay is quite simple. You just move on the board and draw a card to see what you found. The card instructs you to pass a test. So you roll a dice to see what happens.   Eldritch Horror is too simple for my taste. The game is supposed to be a cooperative one but I didn't see how you can actually help the other players. Also the card descriptions are too generic and didn't grab me. I expected that this game would tell me a story like Mansions of Madness where every card has a meaning and there is a story that makes sense. </comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="England">The usual mix of getting resources and turning them into something else. The &#8216;deck building&#8217; nature of the cards does promote a bit of strategy over tactics and the game plays very smoothly and is full of quite a few difficult decisions but I don't think the game overall stands out above most other sych games in my collection.</comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">It's solid, enjoyable and pretty unoriginal.  I like the art work, it plays well and I would happily play it again wothout being tempted to buy it.  I guess its fault may be that it's a bit repetitive in temrs of what you do and that the start is very slow and the end very fast....which is a bit like Antike.  But I think this is much better than Antike since it does not have Kingmaker issues.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">Not wowed by the 2p game. The board was loose, and interaction therefore minimal, although the ability to use your opponent's cards is a very nice touch that extends your deck.  Decent game. Not magical, and probably better with 4-5, which would make for a tighter, more competitive board. However, I'm unlikely to see that player count very often, if at all.  [u]Also with[/u]: Britannia/Germania board. Hoping this will tighten up the flab that plagued the other maps.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Netherlands">I got pretty frustrated with this one.  It's one of those games that you need to have a plan before you start, but since I had no idea what I was doing I just faffed around until I lose miserably.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Italy">[Vote and comment refer to the standard game, without variants of any sort] This game gives you everything you need to bring a great space saga on your table, however TI3 also offers a set of rules that in the end don't seem very well rounded, needing that last tweak or two to "click" properly.  A role selection model is functional if, depending on the situation, each and every role can become your best choice. That doesn't seem to be the case with TI3: having to choose a specific role (Imperial) every round or another specific one (Initiative) whenever the former isn't available is not metagaming, it's an engine that you have to kick every round to make it work properly. The balance among the strategy cards can also become a matter of debate, even considering the difficulties of trying to put together such a variety of contexts (commerce, political options, technological advancements). Playing time is too long and that, of course, is not a fault of the game per se, it's me (you have to rule over an entire galaxy, for Pete's sake, what was I thinking?). The objectives usually support the enforcing of your position without leading to open conflict, with a "cold War" feel that doesn't really fit with my idea of space combat. Please, use at least the Age of Empire variant, unless you want to wander pointlessly around the galaxy while you wait to know what can make you win the game. The command counters system has its own issues: production is coupled with movement, transfer actions are limited to two systems, the fact that command counters need their own economy adds much more problems than the ones they solve, not to mention the strange mix of aspects that they try to put together. I've decided to sell my goods and study some kind of new scientific gizmo, so I can't move my ships. REALLY? Other minor complaints include the balance of some units and the overall "patchwork" feel of the rules, which of course can be a minor flaw as long as everything works properly, but still makes the learning curve quite steep. On the other hand, if you're looking for an immersive experience, TI3 it's really up to the task with its (albeit sporadic) space battles, a complex technology tree, a bit of political role-playing, space exploration and almost everything else you could expect.  Most of all, it's like a space-opera kit that you can use to tailor the game to your tastes, and somewhere in there you could probably find your favourite, mind-blowing, don't-call-us-for-the-next-few-hours space civilization game. The Shattered Empire rulebook is definitely worth a look, because some of its tweaks are easily applicable to the base game even without the extra bits.  The box, the amount of bits and cards, the table you need to keep everything at hand and, of course, the hole in your wallet (made even worse if you consider the expansion): everything about this game seems to be huge. Huge props to FFG's customer service: I got a couple of badly molded units and they took care of the substitution quickly and for free, even if I'm on the other side of the pond. Great overall graphics for a very well implemented theme.  Good rulebook.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">My initial thoughts after one game:  There is a lot to like about TI3. The components are awesome, the scope is enormous, the sheer amount of decisions and options is insane. That being said, after 1.5 hours of rules and 6 hours of gameplay, I didn&#8217;t feel like I did much of anything.  I was never able to move more than 2-3 tiles away from my home system. It would take two whole rounds (or three!) to really move your fleet, which is to say, 2-3 hours of game time. I was involved in only a couple battles, during which my entire fleet was wiped out. Except in one case where my wife destroyed another player in a battle, war seemed to cripple both players rather than help the winner advance &#8211; meaning it was more trouble than it was worth.   The downtime also increased exponentially with each hour of the game. At one point near the end I went over 30 minutes without being involved in the game at all. Also, scoring VP is kind of baffling. I don&#8217;t think anyone had a realistic Secret Objective they could achieve (all had to do with controlling a laughable number of planets and/or Mecatol Rex) and the ISP was only chosen sporadically, so Public Objectives didn&#8217;t really come out until hours 4, 5 and 6.  The sheer length of the game is troubling considering that it takes so long to do anything. I suppose I should have researched it more, but I thought with the high rating on BGG and it being a 6-8 hour game that you would be doing a ton of stuff in an epic space opera. In reality it felt more like Sid Meier's Civilization, the board game, in space (a game I'd be content never to play again). I own and have played Empires of the Void several times, and I feel like I do much more in that game in a total game time of two hours than I ever felt in 6+ hours of TI3.  And yet, despite my misgivings, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the game in the days since. It looks like the expansion and variants like Age of Empires fixes most of the issues I have with it (the snail&#8217;s pace at the beginning, limited chances for VP, rewards turtling over warfare). I would try it again, but I would prefer to do so using a variant that fixes some of the base game&#8217;s many issues. </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">Actually a really good game, but the time factor limits my ability to rate it higher.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">This is THE heavy epic 4X game. I don't know of another that's as pretty and thick as this baby. And that's it's downfall for me - I can't get a group (but maybe once a year or at a con) to play it. It's akin to going out to a really expensive dinner - you do it once a year or so on special occasions, but it's too rich and thick for regular consumption. Too heavy and long for my gaming group - which is a shame because I think I'd play it more often otherwise. </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United Kingdom">The basic game falls short of its potential due to 'over-simplified' politics, trade and technology rules and unbalanced 'strategy cards'.  The expansion fixes many of the 'base game' drawbacks whilst adding [unnecessary] 7 &amp; 8 player option.  The wider community have designed numerous rules modifications, the most comprehensive being 'Shattered Ascension V4' [http://ti3wiki.org/forum/YaBB.pl?board=CommunityVariants].  I'm currently looking for a good set of 'Exploration' type rules if anyone has any suggestions/links? </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">*Rating based on one play.  TI3 was on my gaming "bucket list", a list of well-regarded or popular games that I want to play at least once.  Now that I've crossed TI3 off that list, I'm not sure that I'll ever return to it.  It's not that I disliked TI3, it's just not a game in my wheelhouse.  TI3 is a long, heavily thematic and interactive game, while I prefer shorter, multiplayer solitaire style Eurogames.  Putting genre biases aside (as much as possible), what did I think of TI3?  I would have to say it is one of the better "dudes on a map" games I have played, head and shoulders above the likes of Risk or Axis and Allies.  I like that you have means of being peaceful in the game (though I think winning is impossible if you don't take the gloves off at some point), and I like that players can interact in non-military ways, through trade and politics.  I like the technology tree system, though I would have liked to see each species have its own tree.  The graphics and bits are all quality, though the graphical design of the rulebook shows its age.  I like that the game's end goal is objective-based, and not simply "eliminate all opponents".  That said, I'm not sure I like how the objectives are handled in the game.  In my one play, I found I was usually able to score an objective the turn after it came up.  I even scored my personal, secret objective fairly early, which may have been a rookie mistake as it painted a big bullseye on my head.  When an objective came up that didn't seem achievable, I was left in a sort of holding pattern, not really having a clear direction to go.  When the next objective that came up was simply a more difficult version of the previous, I again felt directionless.  The galaxy was so crowded at that point that any attempt at territorial gains would result in a swift counterattack and could have left me open to losing much of my empire, so the game devolved into a sort of trench warfare where I was simply trying to maintain my borders and hoping the next objective to come up would be achievable.  It made the last third of the game an uninteresting slog.  Even the other players seemed relieved when the game finally ended after some 8 hours.  In the end, I'm glad to have experienced the game, but I don't know that I'll ever come back to it.  I've rated it a 6 as it is a mechanically solid game with a lot of things to like about it, and if it played in just an hour or two, I'd be willing to play it again.  But as an all-day kind of game, I'm not sure I'd want to come back to it.  It's just not my cup of tea.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United Kingdom">We clubbed together to buy this for our group. It's definitely vastly superior to 2nd Ed in my opinion, and I do enjoy the game more since it became more about diplomacy than piles of cruisers. Managing the counter balance on the player mats is particularly fun, but the game still takes a bit too long to finish for my liking (I'd prefer to play 3/4 shorter games). *edit* Revised my rating after further plays. The Imperial thing really annoys me since there are a number of action cards that can put you right out of the game from turn 1. *edit* a member of our group got the expansion, so this may go up in score once we play it </comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="England">This is a deep game with decisions resulting in some very subtle shifts which aren't immediately obvious. Very interesting therefore - at least for the first few plays. If it doesn't become obvious/boring then and holds it's promise then my rating will rise. Two things to watch for though. Analysis paralysis can be significant and so can downtime (particularly as it can be a little difficult/tedious to keep track of dominance in a region)</comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">Finally got in a play of this well-reputed monster of a game. It was indeed quite solid, but terribly lengthy. I can't say there was much that could be thematically trimmed away although the end of game score-every-tile was an extra nail in the coffin to me. It gave me an epic feeling at glacial speed. The complexity of calculations at the result of actions and domination cards encourages lengthy think-a-thon turns which I truly wish could be addressed. It would make for a much improved experience and dramatically shortened play time. Yet for all that, I quite liked it. Would I play it again? In the right mood, I certainly would.</comment>

Still interesting game and I would like to play it in the future at least once more. Rating based on one play.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Australia">Not a fan of games where the scoring escalates exponentially and the brain explodes trying to calculate how to win in the last two or three moves. I prefer games that score a bit less to begin with (no one likes to lose because they got off to a bad start!) and ramp up gradually to compensate, but overall reward the most consistent player. Good game otherwise.</comment>

    <comment game="Patchwork" game_id="163412" location="Austria">Patchwork is a nice two player game. It's quick to explain, easy to play and it has all the qualities of a well designed game... but it's also barely OK, at least in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, playing Patchwork is actually fairly enjoyable, especially when you are in the mood to play something "relaxing", so to speak. It allows you to play an engine building game without a huge number crunching and the complexity typical of these kinds of games. Still it's also very repetitive and it gets old pretty quickly, therefore I really don't understand how this game got to number 38 on the general ranking on BGG. I don't usually care so much about these sort of things, but I really believe that this game is overrated by the community here.  While there's nothing really wrong with Patchwork as a design, there are much better 2-player games on the market right now. It's a good way to spend 20 minutes with your significant other, but not good enough to be so highly regarded. Just an alright game.</comment>
    <comment game="Patchwork" game_id="163412" location="United States">It's rare for an abstract game to entice me, and I came into this not expecting to enjoy it. It's not great, but I'd play it again. </comment>

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">3 plays / 2,5 players  LIKE: Rolling dice and finding combos can be fun and interesting. DISLIKE: it's difficult to know the combos and what to look for the first time playing. Minimal player interaction. Small text on the planets are a negative for me. You really need to know the tiles well.  OVERALL: The dice make the game. I liked it, but low player interaction keeps it from being a great game. This game becomes an efficiency race, which has been done to many times over.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="">It's ok and interesting to play if everyone knows what they are doing, since the game provide different abilities from different tiles.

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United Kingdom">Race for the Galaxy is a favourite game and inevitably that colours my reaction to Roll...  Roll is a clever implementation of the action selection and tableau building of Race using dice and tiles.  On brief acquaintance, the luck of the dice seems about the same as the luck of the cards; the dice have plenty of wild results and several developments offer the power to re-arrange them. Nonetheless, I prefer the speed and simplicity of choosing an action card over rolling arranging and re-arranging a bunch of dice.  Ultimately, I don't think that Roll improves on Race, nor does it offer me a significantly different experience.  However, gamers without my baggage may find Roll the more accessible game.   Production quality is very good.  The dice needed to be small, but the icons on them are clear.  The artwork is good, though less prominent than in Race.</comment>

Using the symbols is fine, but it would be [i]really helpful[/i] if the cards also told you what they did in straightforward text.

Some of the cards feel a bit abstract, too, but I guess that's to be expected in a card game like this.  Besides that, I think it's great game. It actually feels pretty thematic most of the time, and I love the setting of this game (and really don't care for the setting of Puerto Rico). Too bad its a chore to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">The game deserves a better score, I'm just not "there" with it yet, and as such it's less enjoyable for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Canada">I always played with The Gathering Storm and Rebel vs. Imperium.  Steep initial learning curve teaching new players.  I used to rate this higher, but ultimately got tired of shuffling large decks, the luck factor in card draws, and how a game can end before your tableau kicks into high gear. </comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">Very fun, love the sci-fi theme.  I would probably like it better if I hadn't played San Juan first, as it's not as elegant.  The multiple versions of some of the roles really irritates me.  However the added paths to victory and complexity of which decisions are best make it still a great game.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">1st play: Enjoyable, mid-weight game. Lots of opportunity for AP, but as long as it's played with the right group I think it will be fine. The art and presentation are excellent, Days of Wonder, so no surprise. The Djinns are all unique and interact with the board in interesting ways.  2nd play: The game plays quite differently with 3 than with 2. It's more tactical with 3, and AP could bog the game down. It didn't in my group, but I have to be very careful who I play this game with. It doesn't live up to the hype, but very few games could. A good game I'm happy to play.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Canada">A very nice blend of strategy and tactics; you do need both!   It's essentially a victory-point salad sort of game, and filled with AP; but it's not a long game, so the AP is endurable.  My only major complaints are about the art and presentation. First of all, I fear Five Tribes may present some challenges to the colour-blind; and the similarities between the appearances of the various non-meeple wooden pieces make it difficult even for those who happily live in a kaleidoscope. The artwork on the djinn cards is beautiful....and the art everywhere else is fairly bad! It's hard to believe it was all done by the same artist.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">I fear playing this with those prone to analysis paralysis.  The mancala mechanic is intersting, the theme is cool, and the tactics are challenging.  It's got some "points salad" feel to it, but it's fun.  I'd like to try it with 4 players.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="">A little long to teach, compared to the rather fun and friendly game play (ignoring the slavery aspect), and I hate the single-sided money when it's time to hand them out.

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">I like the mechanics, but the inability to do any sort of long-term planning really gets me.  It falls too much on the tactical side for me to really enjoy it, rather than being a strategic game of investment - you really need to do whatever gets you the most points now rather than worry about big plays later in the game.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United States">1st Play: This game felt a lot like wings of war, which make sense given they're the same system. The pacing feels off, with a round of combat followed by 2 rounds of maneuvering just to have another round of misses. The miniatures and production are top notch, the game just isn't as smooth as I would like. I'm also not a miniatures player, so I might not be the right audience for this.   No 2nd play: Not that I'll never give this game a chance, but I'm not enough of a Star wars fan (or any mini's game) to really get into a system like this. It's well produced and the theme is excellent, just not for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="Australia">Slick.   Everything about this is a promise fulfilled in terms of the big-company, big-license game. Finally FFG gets the little things right: the rules are finally at-standard, the fans get their 'realism' and the game doesn't drown in superfluous components.   The game is just fun, fun, fun. It's accessible (which Wings of War is not, strangely). It's fast (not only a 20-30 minute game, but turns move fast). It's got enough skill and granularity to keep you interested.   Unfortunately, I gave up on it when it seemed like you needed a tonne of ships and playspace to make the to-and-fro interesting. If you want a customisable minis game, I think this is worth it, but if you want an affordable board game, might be too much $$$.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="Singapore">A very good remix version of wings of war. The minis are really great looking and decent in size.   Game play is easy for both beginners and some complexity for intermediate gamers alike.  Like Wings, this game suffers a bit from the 2D-3D space representation. In that sense, the game lack that dimension to move those ships in combat.  As a wave by wave collectable, it makes the spending less painful.  Good introductory game</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United States">Great concept, medium design and implementation.  Games tend to run a little too long.  The luck based combat can be frustrating.  But it is so much fun to dogfight in the star wars universe.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="France">The games always start out freaking awesome but always end up with a couple ships trying to outmaneuver each other for like a million turns. I still do like it though.</comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">This is an average game that is as average as average gets.  The game never feels like it is progressing and the secret lord cards play the game for you.

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Rated after one play.  A fun worker placement game, although I'd probably pick Caylus over this one.  ---  Another play in and this one's rating is already starting to drop.  Unlike other worker placement games that I've played, this one only seems to have one path to victory (complete quests).  As such, Lords of Waterdeep turns into an optimization game of who can complete their quests in the most efficient manner.  Compare this to Caylus or Agricola where players can get points through a variety of means.  Waterdeep is a game that I probably won't turn down, but will never suggest to play.</comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">A typical worker placement Euro with an Ameritrash theme pasted on.  It plays well, but doesn't have anything original about it.  Those who dislike direct conflict will be turned off by the Intrigue cards, some of which can be used to directly attack opponents.  UPDATE: After a second play, I've lowered my rating a half point because I feel like there is too much luck involved in the game with regards to Quest cards and Intrigue cards.  Drawing the right Quest cards to match with one's Lord card plays too big a factor for my liking, and it's a largely random factor.  Sure, there are ways to bury Quest cards that other players may need, but taking an action to set back a single opponent at some cost to yourself is a net loss for you in games of 3+ players.  The same is true of the Mandatory Quests.  Playing a Mandatory Quest on one player doesn't affect any other players, and costs you an Intrigue card play.  All in all, it's an okay game, but a bit too random and confrontational to make a good Euro game.  +Fun theme that may appeal to those turned off by the usual Euro game themes. +Nice gateway to Euro-style games. +Easy to learn.  -Lots of direct attacks on other players. -Possibility of king-making. -Large degree of randomness involved in Quest cards.</comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">People talk about how they want a replacement or reimplementation of Arkham Horror and the common answer is Eldritch. I think that's incorrect for a series of reasons, but mostly because MoM2e fits much better in terms of why people don't like EH as a replacement (it's a fine game, but it's different). MoM2e requires you to engage monsters, there are more consequences, the tension ratchets up as folks become deranged or damaged since there is no easy/consistent way of healing. The Mythos phase is something everyone fears much more. It's much more confined and almost claustrophobic in feel compared to EH's more worldly romp. In short, it's a Lovecrafting experience more so than EH is in many ways. The app is rather slick, even if you do spend a lot of time "heads down" in the app instead of engaged in the board or with other players.  I think some things really annoy me about the game though, the inability to heal is thematic, but an annoyance. That I get pegged by the Mythos phase *and* have to do a horror check against critters makes sense, but sort of sucks as you spend all of this time beating on stuff just to avoid gaining gobs of horror. I sort of regret basing the minis, but really, this is a game where the minis are super clunky but sweet (and helpful in terms of narrative as they are imposing with bases, and it makes the rooms crowded) to look at on the board... A real storage solution would help, I guess if I was willing to dedicate a suitcase or a ginormous wad of plick-n-pluck and build something... Last, even for an Ameritrash-style game, it's on rails courtesy of the scenario-driven system and as such, once you play through a scenario two, maybe three times, it falls flat (e.g. you know you have X turns until a critter spawns here, and you know what information an NPC is going to give you).  For a thematic experience though, it's hard to beat, but I come away from playing with a sour taste in my mouth for some reason, I don't know. I waffle on a 6 or 7; I want to play it again, but the scenario I've had trouble with is more of a "do I really think I can beat this" mechanical exercise anymore... In some ways, it should be a 2 strike system ala Pandemic:Legacy; if you can't get it after 2 (maybe 3) tries, then move on as the very thing that it excels at (theme) falters with repeated play...</comment>

Despite my conflicted opinion of this game, I did purchase some of the expansions for it. In view of that, Mansions does appear to have some magic in it.   I wouldn't have bought this game if I hadn't found it on sale for a good discount from MSRP. It's more a $60 game than a $100 game. </comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United Kingdom">Random elements make this game feel more like a ride than something you can influence and control. The app has sound effects and voice talent BUT it is concentrated in the first few turns of the first scenario and is more or less missing from the rest of the scenarios!   I feel that the app should have more sound effects for monsters and much more varied music, perhaps even procedurally generated sequences to heighten tension.  The price of this game is extremely high and it isn't great value in my opinion. If I didn't already have first edition and the expansions I would've given this a miss entirely on the basis of prohibitive cost.  Having said all that I have had a blast with this game, it is simple enough to entice non gamers and has just enough meat on the bones for veterans too. The pricing structure for future scenarios will dictate whether this stays in my collection or not. </comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">A great game. Can get a little bit "same-y" after a while.

Make sure your friends will play it with you before purchasing. :)</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Australia">Good tense co-op game, but too long for its weight, almost feels like doing the same turn iteration over too many turns. I feel it is too long for its depth (at ~5 hours almost the same as Arkham Horror). Rating will increase if smoother with more plays, and I would say game is an 8 if you are a fan of the series as it matches its theme quite well.</comment>

    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="">This is a provisional rating, since I only played once. I didn't enjoy, but it may also have been an unfortunate playthrough.

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">Easily the best 2-player implementation of the series. Possibly the best overall? The only reason this doesn't get higher marks is because my interest in point salads is waning. I like games which have a more streamlined focus on what you are trying to do, which is perhaps why train games and abstracts have risen in my estimation.  Still want to give this some more plays to see if familiarity with the buildings, conversion chains, and resource chokepoints brings the underlying game theory into clearer focus. </comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="Denmark">A fine game but nothing fantastic here in my eyes. I would rather play Agricola. I just wanted a bit more pressure or focus in the game, instead of a do whatever you want type of game.

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">Some fun mechanics, I like the aesthetics of the game, but the scoring feels desultory and disconnected.

Quite a lot going on but easy to pick up the basics.  Random card draws for what grapes you grow and what wine customers want can bog a player down if nothing decent comes up and some cards seem to offer big points which led to a sudden victory in the game I played.  Okay game but not good enough to knock Snowdonia off my number one spot.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">Viticulture Essentials presents a streamlined package of the previous Viticulture/Tuscany.  It is smooth and quick with fantastic components and the usual Stonemaier attention to detail.  It is also still swingy and random enough to be unsatisfying at times.  To be fair, I'm not big on race games.  This is a good race game but I'd likely choose other race games (Steampunk Rally, for example) and would DEFINITELY choose Vinhos over this any day for a wine theme.  Once the new Tuscany board is available again, that'll likely improve things.</comment>

  <note value="7">
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">A fantastic spin on the traditional Pandemic experience. Without spoiling anything, there are a number of changes that occur throughout the game that I think give it a fresh enough experience that should give even the seasoned Pandemic player something new to tinker with (and that's well appreciated). In particular, I think the Legacy system is really well suited for this sort of endeavor and in the event of a sequel, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up. If nothing else, to get 15-25 games out of a boardgame which ran about $55 isn't bad. The opportunity cost itself works out to a series of evenings which have wondrous and fresh experiences, even if they do seem familiar. This is one of the few games which really ventures into new territory without dropping the replay value considerably (e.g. TIME Stories).  On that note, there are some problems which I think exist here that Pandemic doesn't normally exhibit. First, we find that the game is sort of tied to a group of people so if you find yourself gaming with larger groups and different people each week/month/session then this becomes a much more difficult sell. Second, while the game's Legacy component does overcome some of my problems with how Pandemic became stale, ultimately this game will come to an end, and when it does, it's less attractive than normal Pandemic as the expansions aren't intended for this (but someone might be able to finagle it, who knows).  So while I do like this more than regular Pandemic (at this time rated a 6) for the exhilarating romp through a new disease evolution which is unlike most other games, ultimately it's going to end and fall over to the memory pile so I find it difficult to rate it a 9 or 10 when it's not expected to live past the number of iterations or time span that my other favorites have. Second, it's not a game I can suggest for just anyone, it requires a certain group to play (although, with the right group, one of the fall months can be super funny).  Finding a rating on BGG sort of implies some sort of replay-ability, and after 16 games of it, I'm glad to be done. In that regard, I think P:L is a comfortable 7, maybe a strong 6.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">This game has to be played on a binge.  If you're only going to play once every 4 weeks or less, you'll probably be better off just playing regular Pandemic.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">Unbalanced and too easy at 2. Fun although 3/4 of that is opening the chests/dossier. At the end of the day it's better than vanilla Pandemic, but it's still in that universe and I could care less about the theme. It is a good game, and a great experience. But I'm not breaking down the door to continue our campaign </comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">I like this game.  Pandemic is a nice game that is easy to teach, so it has made numerous appearances at the table.  My personal opinion is the legacy idea really helps Pandemic shine, giving any game a story is a huge benefit.  I love progression and variety, the plot really shines here.  However the added complexity is an actual downside to my family as we've gone from month to month.  I'm a wargamer so this game is not complicated to me, but I understand that it's bothersome to suddenly stop a game mid-session and read off 3-4 new rules and sort through some new game components.  Anyway I applaud what the designers have done here.  They've taken a decent game and created a wonderful game experience.  I won't rate this higher because once I've finished my 12 or so games, it's done and can't be repeated (without buying another set).  I'm very happy to share this game with my family, but I'm definitely not looking for more Legacy style games in my collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="Switzerland">Played with 2, I guess it's better with 3/4 player +: Excellent play experience. You must try this -: rules for each mission should be a bit clearer  </comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="Spain">Very good spin-off of pandemic. Still playing, I do not know were the game will take me but the journey has been interesting so far.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">Overhyped. If you LOVE Pandemic and play it regularly, this is going to blow your socks off, but it's not the end-all-be-all of gaming that it's been presented as. If you're already tired of base Pandemic then this is just going to be ~20 more games of that with some extra mechanisms thrown in. The Legacy content is more interestingly different than in Risk Legacy, but also less exciting.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="Brazil">Ok, at the start it is exactly like Pandemic, but on the progress we've made the game is about to change a lot. I won't evaluate it proper until we finish our campaign, but it is a solid game for the ones who enjoy Pandemic. I liked the Legacy system a lot, it is really cool the way things get delivered to players as the game progress.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="">The first game takes twice as long... after that still on the higher. Games are not going to finish in 2 hours...  This is a definite improvement over the last release version. Streamlining some of the military issues and improving the resource tracking are definitely nice. With very many minor tweaks.    </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">Way overhyped but still an outstanding game. This is a good introduction to war games, and building games in general. Player interaction will make or break this one, and careful observation is a useful aid. Trust no one. </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="England">I'm in two minds about this - I feel I should like it more than I do because the theme is excellent but I suspect to really enjoy it you need to invest the time that will give you a better idea of the cards in the game and truth is there are other games that I'd rather spend my limited time on. Catch 22?</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">A very good wargame-ish Cold War card-driven game. Very tense a lot of the time, and the theme is very well implemented. DEFCON status, the space race, and all the events and ways you can try to influence nations just add up to an intense experience that is very thematic. Very fast paced and tense, though the cards can cause big swings of luck for one of the players sometimes.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">As CDGs go, this is incredible. For anyone to turn "The Cold War" into anything this tension-filled and interesting is an achievement. This reminds me of Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, but with much more going on, much of it quite subtle -- yet satisfying.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">I thought this was a really interesting game.  Unfortunately the girlfriend was not amused.  A swift Soviet victory is apparently not a way to endear this game to others.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="Germany">The theme is caught quite well, but I couldn't see a longtime strategy. Overall you just do what your cards allow you to do and this is really luck dependend. I like the mechanic, that no one is allowed to let the war escalate, but I think this feature could have made more dominant.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">Fun.  Can be very tense.  </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">Quite a game. Need to play more before the decisions are instinctive, but I can easily see this becoming an 8 or higher game!</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="Malaysia">10 turns or less, each turn you'll have 8 cards (additionally the China card) to be played in 6 rounds per turn, most of the cards can be used to do either realignment/ space race/ trigger event/ place influence/ attempt coup, mostly to control some countries, scoring card is a must-play before the turn ends or you'll lose. If you use opponent's card for any action except space race, your opponent gets to play the event on the card, you want to avoid this as much as you can. Starting with headline phase then action rounds then military operations status check. The game ends if any player controlled all European battleground countries during Europe region scoring or any player gets 20/-20 points or highest score by the end of round 10 or any player trigger DEFCON 0. The most special thing about TS is the various way you can use the cards. Most of the time I just check the operation point on the card &amp; whether the opponent's event will affect my territory badly or not then take the best action with the card without really paying attention with the historical events.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United Kingdom">Excellent 2 player strategy game. Enough variables to 'de-Eurofy' it and stopping it becoming 'formulaic'.</comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">We have been playing this much more regularly and can finish a 3 player game in under 90 minutes.  This game is slowly creeping up my top 10 list...In my books it's a solid 8 right now, but I don't see it going anywhere but up!</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Scotland">Just an all round solid euro.  Heavy but accessible.  First time learning and teaching takes a while as there is a lot going on but it all falls in to place when you start playing.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Wales">Rules explanation took approaching an hour, which serves to show the amount of different elements which make up Terra Mystica. Despite that, the rules feel fairly intuitive once playing - everything hangs together well. It may be slightly overcooked, as seems to be the trend in 2012/13 with big-hitters Bora Bora, Tzolkin and the like, but it doesn't feel as bulky as those other titles. It's an intelligent game, which doesn't outstay its welcome. I don't know if I really fancy ever having to teach it to someone else, so it may not be one I ever purchase!</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">4 plays / 3,4 players.  LIKE: Different races all have different powers and combos, which make mixed strategies. Deep decision tree, the strategies have interesting arcs.  DISLIKE: Very disparate mechanisms. The cult track seems tacked on. I almost want the cult and magic tokens to work together, but I understand why they did it this way. The bits can be fiddly. Many, many corner case rules. The game is difficult to comprehend first time through.  OVERALL: The more I play this, the higher my rating gets. The map and tracks add a nice competitive element, and both are tied to your strategy. The game seems similar to Tzolk'in.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">I'm not usually a fan of area-control games, but this one has enough resource management and economic engine building to make it interesting for me.  It feels a little like a cross between Small World and Settlers of Catan (but without Catan's randomness).  There's very little randomness and lots of paths to victory, which is good.  Why don't I rate it higher?  Mostly because of my aforementioned disinterest in area control games, and because TM doesn't do anything particularly innovative.  It's a solid game, but not one I'd want to play regularly.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">Good game.  Just not sure it fits into my play groups.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">This is a very good game but it requires a bit more long-term planning than I usually enjoy. Playing by intuition will be heavily punished by those who math things out.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">Enjoyed immensely.  However, since I only played the once, it seemed like there was a thousand things to track and thousand things to do at once.  Leads to AP.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">A couple of tense theatrical moments-- battles, secrets, etc. in my first (and to this point only) game, have me hoping to get this to the table soon and often.  A bit of a long haul though.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Star Wars: Rebellion is an action selection game masquerading as a war game.  While the fleet actions and combat are an important element of the game, the crux of the game is the use of the game's leaders.  The Rebels are not going to win a war campaign against the Empire.  Instead, they have to use clever planning and strategy to survive the Imperial onslaught and buy time to rally the galaxy to their side.  On the Imperial side, the war game is much more important, but as an occupying force, the Empire cannot clump their ships and troops together to crush the Rebel fleets, but must spread out their forces to ensure find the Rebel base and prevent the Rebels from going to ground if found.  The game is dripping with Star Wars theme.  All the main characters from the original trilogy are there and your odds of seeing them in most games are high.  The events, objectives, projects, and action cards all fit the game's flavor.  The artwork and models are all spot-on, and seeing everything on the board engrosses you in the theme.  The game does have its downsides.  First, it is long, likely taking a good 4-6 hours to play.  That may not be a hurdle to some people, but for me it will mean the game is a special occasion type of game, rather than a regular game night favorite.  Second, there is a fair helping of randomness in the game with the use of dice in mission attempts and combat, but you'll be rolling dice frequently enough that luck should balance out for both sides.  And I think the more experienced, more strategic-minded player will win the majority of the time.  And third, the replayability of the game might not quite be what you might expect from a $100 game.  I've played twice, both times as the Rebels, and so have seen most of the cards that side has to offer come up during games.  The second game definitely did not feel the same as the first, and I think it would not feel samey if you only play once a month or less, but if you were to play it weekly, it might get tiring before too long.  I think the game will stand up to multiple plays, but I wouldn't turn down an expansion with some added missions and objectives.  One last area I wanted to address is the multiplayer rules.  I have played the game both as a 2 player and a 4 player game, and I liked both very much.  I was skeptical about the multiplayer rules, because they seemed tacked on to what would be best as a 1 vs 1 game, but they really turned out to be a lot of fun.  The snaking turn order really adds an extra wrinkle to the game, and both players feel like they have enough responsibilities to feel like an equal team.  Granted I played the game with a cooperative partner, so if you end up with a selfish or bossy partner, your experience may be ruined, but I put that on the player and not the game.  Rebellion is a great "event" game, i.e. one to be played infrequently on special occasions.  I liked it much more than my recent play of Twilight Imperium 3, and I would even prefer it to something like Star Wars: Imperial Assault.  It might be hard for some to justify $100 for a game that will not see the table often, but if it fits your budget and you are a Star Wars fan, this is a must-have.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Long. But I had a great time playing it 2 v 2. The Game looks great on the table.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Australia">Fun game but costs way too much for a 2-player experience.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Italy">This is the most epic game ever made with the Star Wars license: a two-player struggle between the Galactic Empire and the Rebellion, encompassing the whole civil war.  It is essentially a card driven game, with leaders assigned to mission cards as the main mechanic, so it is necessary to memorize (or at least have a more than vague idea about) the cards in each deck. The political control and resource/unit production are both simple and elegant, while the combat system is a bit clunky and time-consuming (but not too-much convoluted).  The length of the game will keep it from hitting the table too much, but when it does, it's epicness will unravel in all its magnificence... Well done, FFG!</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United Kingdom">Great game, I have left it short of a 10 as I think that there could be some 'set strategies' that could win it for either side, the game may be a bit short (in turns) as it seems quite easy for the Rebels to get reputation thus stifling some things that the Empire player can do (build a 2nd DS or an SSD) or might try (I never thought of destroying a system in case I gifted reputation, and the win, to the Rebels), That's probably being super critical and i'll probably change it to a 10 soon :-)  After five games with the same opponent we are struggling to see how the Rebels can win against a decent player running the Empire. The only close game was the first two with me playing the Empire and not really knowing what I was doing. And don't even get me started about the setup system draw having Rebel systems right beside Empire systems, twice now I have lost two systems on the first turn.  Have to drop my rating because of this.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Yes it's "Star Wars in box." And it's enjoyable if you like games that heavily lean on theme. I find it a little long for what it is though, and don't think has the legs a fairly epic game like this should have. It's cool when it twists on the events of the movies, but that novelty quickly wears off. A good time, but I don't get a charge out of it like I do some other favorite of this length.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Netherlands">Very good but not excellent game. As a game it works just fine but doesn't stimulate much thrill.</comment>

    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">I was part of the first and third wave of playtesting, and I am very excited with where this game is going.

    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">This game feels like Copycat, in that it shamelessly steals mechanics from other good games in an attempt to make one cohesive game, but without the satire. The end result is typical of the designer; a reasonably good game with nothing remarkable or groundbreaking about it except for the amount of chrome applied. </comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Poland">I start to really like that game. Non-obvious balance. Sometimes it is hard to undo your early mistakes (especially when you try to play in a way that is definately not supported by your boards). But still, facy to play. Played Saxony, Poland and yellow guys.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United Kingdom">Good but undoubtedly overhyped as there are better games that do pretty much the same thing. It's an attractive looking game, but the board is unnecessarily large with a completely pointless oversized reverse. Gameplay is varied, with multiple ways to win even if the first part is very slow.</comment>

    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">One of the best light 4x game creations ever! I hope to see an expansion developing those 4x's further, modular in design for optional use of each. Combined with its 6-7 player expansion, that would make it perhaps BETTER than Eclipse.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Wales">Really good alternative version of Agricola, with less variability between games, less tension, and more convoluted rules. An excellent game but not a replacement for the exceptional original.  Sold while still hard-to-get to ensure I didn't lose too much on my investment! I really can't see me choosing to play this over Agricola any time soon.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United Kingdom">My worry about this game is that by removing nearly all the randomness, you're left without much of a game and instead you just choose which strategy to follow and there just isn't enough replayability here. Wouldn't want to play this with more than 5 and I've yet to try it solo. It's a shame because he's made some nice improvements but has he left enough?</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Singapore">A very enjoyable game, which fixes a lot of problems it's predecessor Agricola had, such as having an imitation action and simplifying the scoring system. It is accessible and not too hard to learn for even new gamers but still has a lot of dept and strategy to it. And win or lose, the satisfaction of looking at one's cave farm is always satisfying for most at the end of the game.  </comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">A great game!  I would rate this higher except I knew Agricola, and loved it, first.  Caverna is Agricola with some streamlining.  While Agricola has some flaws (streaky cards, mainly), I do think they can be easily addressed while maintaining the overall fluid nature of the game (draft them).  Caverna squashes that broad decision tree into a static pool of rooms that are always available to everyone (at least initially).  In my mind this inhibits the replay value, though it does make the game a bit more approachable and accessible.  My rating could improve with more plays.  It's just that when I play Caverna I always first ask myself "why aren't we playing Agricola?"</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Spain">One game with six players. Too many components. Too much space. Unnecessary complication.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Good game, very similar to Agricola.  Much more freeform, which is nice, but with all the extra options you lose a lot of the streamlined decisions that made Agricola so interesting.  Will play if suggested, but not interested in picking it up.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Wales">I was expecting a more advanced version of Agricola (one of my favourite Euros). Instead the range of choices make it a simpler more forgiving version. The 'adventuring' just seems to be a simple way of getting resources etc and a lame attempt at making a fantasy version of Agricola. Also the tiles allow for less replayability than all the minor improvement and occupation cards in Agricola. Not a bad game just not as challenging as Agricola.</comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="">Though initially it may seem simple it evolves into the challenge of trying to get your opponent to reveal cards that you need while allowing them only the least useful cards for themselves.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Finland">This is an outstanding version of 7 Wonders for two players, much better than the 2 player variant the original game provides. On every turn you are facing interesting tactical decisions which card to take and what options you leave for your opponent. This creates a similar feel to drafting cards but manages to overcome the dullness of the exercise you experience with just 2 players. Moreover, the threat of instant victory electrifies the atmosphere adding to the tension. Well done.  Perhaps this Duel version features a bit more strategic depth since you can see a part of what is coming and you can try to plan further ahead while in the original game you are navigating through foggy waters, i.e., you can try to follow some longer term plan but quite often the current draws you somewhere else.  Moreover, in addition to the wonders you can aim on the technology benefits and build your strategy on them.   However, the game is still 7 Wonders and I would not call it better or worse as a whole. Duel is definitely an improvement for 2 players and I am happy to play it anytime.</comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Austria">An outstanding production and a great 2-player adaptation of a modern classic in a conveniently small package. What really impressed me the most about 7 Wonders Duel is how the designers managed to create a fairly different game, which still feels a lot like the original. This is something that should really serve as a proof of their talent!   It's almost redundant to talk about component quality. Besides maybe the cards being a little too small, everything about the production quality of this game is simply stellar! On the game-play front, 7 Wonders Duel flows perfectly fast and smooth thanks to the mechanism of the pyramid. This elegant solution keeps the game simple, preserves the drafting-feel but it also creates a tense back-and-forth between the players. The overall experience is indeed significantly tighter than regular 7 Wonders. The game really got much meaner... it's a real duel, where you're messing up with your opponent all the time by denying him/her cards, developing a monopoly of one resource or menacing him/her with military strength.  All that being said, I still prefer regular 7 Wonders because of the expansions that it got, which significantly enhance the game-play for me by adding variety, depth and interesting combos. Duel doesn't offer yet quite as much of that... but I think the expansion will fix this issue very soon. I do have instead a minor complaint about the game. Because of how the pyramid works, it's terribly important to manipulate the turn order... and therefore it's really crucial to get the wonders that allow you to take another turn. Otherwise you might find yourself in a position where there's no way you can deny your opponent the card that he/she really needs. This creates a weird feeling of unbalanced first-player problem... which is actually not entirely there, because you just need to learn how to address it. Still it bothers me a little though.  Overall 7 Wonders Duel is a very well put together package. It's easy to carry around, it has beautiful artwork and components and it offers a pretty interesting game-play. It can be mean, but it's a great game for couples that don't mind a little confrontation every now and then. Recommended!</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Spain">I borrowed from a friend and we liked it. Fast and interesting 2-player game. In some aspects better than 7 Wonders. I will likely get my own copy at some point.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Canada">I think that this game has its pros and cons over regular 7 wonders, but it definitely is enjoyable, and I look forward to playing it again. There are a lot of things to remember, and it definitely helps to have knowledge of the original game. It's gotten rid of some fiddly bits, and simplified some aspects, while some aspects make it more difficult and almost seem as if there is less choice. Overall, a good game that I have nothing bad to say about, but also not the best that I've played.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Belgium">Very engaging and efficient game. It manages to pack in a small play time the typical ingredients of a light civ game, with a supply of cards reminiscent of the pyramid of the Valley of Kings, but more diversified.  Very solid game, but need to play it more to form an opinion.</comment>

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">This game is enjoyable. IMO, better than CATAN. Every player has roughly the same amount of chance to win from the get-go. In addition, the game corrects itself by buffing roles that aren't picked as often over the course of the game. Unfortunately, I am less than willing to play this with a new group of people, which in the end detracts from the review.  </comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Both of my brothers own Puerto Rico and I've played it several times.  Definitely a solid, well crafted game, though a bit overly meticulous at times.  I always enjoy a play.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">I remember the first time I was introduced to this game... I wanted to rip my eyeballs out. Of course, this was back in the dark ages when I was just getting introduced into these newfangled board games, and I'll admit I was a bit overwhelmed. How far we have come... I tried it again a few months later and it quickly became a favorite of my wife and I. And now we barely play it. The life cycle of games...  Still, a great game, and a classic. Of all the "gateway games" we own (Ticket to Ride, Settlers, Carc, Dominion) this is the one I like the best.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">This game has a very chess like mentality that starts out slow and builds into a wider picture. I enjoy this game when I feel like a highly strategic sort of game play.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United Kingdom">one of the most liked in my group. I do like it as well. The rating would have been higher if the game was meant for 2 players and if the components were better.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">One of my first true euros, and one of the best.  There is a lot of player interaction via the role selections and always a lot of tough decisions to make.  I am mediocre at it, but I always enjoy it.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Ah, yes. </comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">This game has a problem similar to Dominion in that people who have played this game often have a distinct advantage over people who have not played as much. Every time I have played this game, it has been with people who have played the game 10x+ my play experience so I get crushed in actual score.  That being said, the game is still enjoyable. It is engine building and there are very many valid ways to build an engine and claim victory.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Australia">I can see why this game is so highly rated and can admire it as a game, but I'd only want to play it a couple of times a year. There's a pretty steep learning curve that can put newcomers off.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Legos for adults. Build an engine and see if it works well. If not, build another one next time. Fun whether you win or lose.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">I enjoy this game, its a lot deeper than most non-gamers usually play but they seem to pick it up fairly easy. I find there is a good amount of strategy but I have heard complaints that once you play it enough it becomes a 'spreadsheet game' and plays itself... luckily I haven't gotten to that point.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">This is  a great game.  I have a hard time finding people to play it with me though.  I really want to play more to get a better feel for everything going on in the game.</comment>

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Malta">Virtually luck free. Difficult choices each turn - enhances play. Although not evident, good player interaction. Neat components.

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">I've only played a few games but all have contained great choices, frustrating surprises and lots of fun up to the finish. I'll be happy to play many more games of this one. I also own the expansion but really haven't seen the need to use it yet. UPDATE: the game is still neat, but feels kinda "samey" from play to play. I no longer attempt to get this one to the table, but will definitely play if others request it.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Use to play this all the time as it was my first heavy Euro, but over the years it got less exciting compared to other games.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">The quality of this game is heavily dependent on the players of a given session - because there is no randomness (aside from the players' decisions) and no hidden information of real consequence, the only risk you take is in underanalyzing your move, which can make play a little sterile. Also, if a weak player is to a strong player's right, it can completely unbalance the game. Despite that, this is an interesting, well-crafted game that is quite enjoyable if played by people of equal skill level. Do yourself a favor and avoid strategies for this game; part of the fun is feeling out what works for yourself.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Setup is kind of a pain.  The game is fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Wales">After one play, I hardly feel I have scratched the surface of this game. It is clearly deep, involved, rich, and very strategic. I have some knowledge of the lighter card-game San Juan, so it came fairly naturally to me, but it is a complex affair. I was surprised to find it wasn't a long game, even with five players. It certainly didn't outstay its welcome. The only significant criticism for me is the appearance of it. The theme is dry and the board/tokens reflect this. It's all text, very little imagery and rather boring to look at. Compared to the lovely artwork in Agricola (a game of similar weight) it looks a little tired. But I was glad to find that in my first play of Puerto Rico, it lived up to the hype.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United Kingdom">Playing face to face is just so slow. That is why this is best with 2 players.</comment>

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Poland">2016-06-23 (rating 7.5):  Initially I liked it a bit more. But now after many, many games in the Polish league I'm no longer so found of it.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Canada">I have mixed feelings for this game.  Components are cheap and dull.   Setup/cleanup is tedious.  I also do not like dice rolling fest games although that one is an exception as it let you mitigate the luck factor in several clever ways.  All in all, the game flows well and requires a long terms strategy to win.  It also scale very well from 2 to 4 players.   Burgundy is surely not my favorite but I enjoy it nonetheless.</comment>

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">+ Easy to teach; Fairly quick to play; Many different focuses that you can go for in an attempt to win. - Can feel a bit same-y after playing the game multiple times.   Why it's previously-owned: Even with different maps at the outset, this game feels too similar from one play to the next to me.  I ended up leaving this game with my relatives who feel in love with it's balance of strategy and ease-of-play.</comment>

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">Great two player game. I prefer to draft cards as I find random draw to leave too much up to chance in a game like this. With more than two players I prefer the cardless variant because it cuts the playing time to something reasonable.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">I enjoy this game even if my wife enjoys it more than me. While somewhat complicated at first after a couple plays it starts to click and you start to really develop strategies. My one gripe is that it is super hard to organize all the pieces, I mean just resetting the board every round is a game in itself...</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Germany">German - 25 EUR  Really complex game with a fresh theme. It just has not enough player interaction and that is why I prefer the Interactive Deck. But even in that variant, I can't really say that I woul suggest to play the game with my group. The theme would be perfect for non-gamers, but the mechanics are so dry that it is only suitable for experienced gamers.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Germany">Habe meine Meinung revidiert. Zuerst fand ich das Spiel nur schlecht, aber nun nach 3 weiteren Spielen, finde ich es immerhin so gut, dass ich behalten werde. Ich bin zwar immer noch der Meinung, das ich es schade finde, das am Ende die Runden zur Ernte immer k&#252;rzer werden (ich sehe auch keinen Sinn drin, wenn man schon etwas aufbaut, was der Realit&#228;t entsprechen soll!), aber es hat mir nun trotzdem Spa&#223; gemacht. Aber am besten spielt man es mit Karten, damit man am Ende wenigstens noch etwas machen kann, anosnsten ist es meist nur ein gegurke ums aufr&#252;sten. Deshalb auch im Moment nur eine 7, aber auch das k&#246;nnte h&#246;her werden. Gro&#223;er Vorteil. Durch die Karten wird man nie immer und die gleiche Strategie fahren! Deshalb sollte der Langzeitspielspa&#223; ungebremst sein.</comment>

I think this is ideally suited for (asynchronous) online play, and I want to try that out. That might shoot my score up.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">An interesting and sweeping epic game without the epic gameplay time (some might disagree with that). Each game tells a story, the game mechanics are interesting and keep things moving at a brisk pace, and the decisions that are balanced against each other are difficult and challenging. I've enjoyed every playing of this, win or lose... even when misinterpreting rules.  Speaking of rules, my one criticism of this game is the manner in which the rules are presented. Finding answers to questions that arise during the game is quite difficult due to not knowing the section of the rules (basic, intermediate, or advanced rules) to peruse. It's very frustrating.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Germany">Normally you have boardgames with supporting card usage, and this game works the other way around. Many Cards and an oversized board which is just used as a scoretrack. The core mechanics are quite similar to Origins - How we became humans, where each wood marker can be used for different purposes. It is shorter than other civilization-games but it also lacks the epic feeling of other games which take up to 12h. </comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Spain">Tengo sentimientos muy opuestos de amor-odio con este juego xD Tras ya varias partidas, por ahora me gusta pero me ha decepcionado bastante, ya que despu&#233;s de todo lo positivo que tiene, tiene algunas cartas muy desproporcionadas. Y que est&#233; tan desequilibrado a lo militar, no me gusta, sobretodo a 2 jugadores, donde la estrategia militar es casi la &#250;nica a seguir (probarlo a 2 con la variante "pac&#237;fica"), y tambi&#233;n cierto azar que tiene el juego, interesante de base, pero exagerado como consecuencia de estas cartas desproporcionadas (OP)  sobretodo de guerras y algunos l&#237;deres) lo transforman en un intento de gran juego sin llegar a conseguirlo 100%. Que salga ese l&#237;der o guerra en el momento justo, y sobretodo, que te salga a t&#237; o al enemigo por puro azar, o una guerra que le quita al m&#225;s d&#233;bil tropecientosmil puntos, para d&#225;rselos a quien gana... etc, y cebarse siempre con el m&#225;s d&#233;bil, lo convierte en un juego dif&#237;cil de digerir despu&#233;s de muchas horas de dura gesti&#243;n. A parte de ser un juego muy abstracto, que no tengo problema con eso al respecto, pero en consecuencia tardas en pillarle el rollo al no ser en principio lo l&#243;gico o intuitivo lo mejor. Habr&#225; quien le guste, pero "currartelo" tanto, y durante varias horas en un juego muy muy largo,(yo lo estoy jugando casi exclusivamente online, por su duraci&#243;n) para que al final esos detalles descompensados y azarosos decidan, pues a mi me decepciona mucho, sobretodo el azar de los eventos finales. Quiero probar otras variantes, sin guerras o pac&#237;ficas a ver... Vlaada, que lo considero gran autor, y con juegos con grand&#237;simas ideas, a mi me da la sensaci&#243;n que no termina de redondear sus juegos, ni de equilibrarlos, y siempre acaban teniendo alg&#250;n defecto importante... (El Dungeon Lords y Galaxy Trucker acabaron saliendo de mi ludoteca). Ser&#225; su estilo pero a mi no me termina de gustar, y me da la sensaci&#243;n de muy poco testeo... aunque em realidad no sea as&#237;. Que rabia, con lo que podr&#237;a haber sido este juego... Por el concepto, me parece un grand&#237;simo juego en s&#237; (sin hablar de las ediciones ni componentes), pero por todo lo dicho, ni de lejos un rank 2 de la BGG...   Otra cosa: Tema vs. jugabilidad: Lo ideal es un equilibrio siempre en los juegos, pero si hay que disminuir uno para mejorar otro, opino que siempre se deber&#237;a mejorar la jugabilidad, es un juego, no una novela. Muchos justifican en este juego el desbalanceo militar, porque es como han dominado las civilizaciones siempre. Bueno, pues que casi no sepas escribir y que tengas un gran ej&#233;rcito del medievo que pueda arrasar tu civilizaci&#243;n del siglo XX que dispone de misiles, tem&#225;tico no es la palabra! xD Que esto est&#233; justificado por la jugabilidad, estar&#237;a bien, pero tampoco es el caso, ya que los puntos de cultura/victoria, no represantar&#237;an para nada lo avanzada que est&#225; la civilizaci&#243;n, y m&#225;s cuando de esta forma puedes intercambiar much&#237;simos con una de las guerras. En fin que es muy abstracto y nada tem&#225;tico, para cumplir m&#225;s con la jugabilidad.   Descripci&#243;n/opini&#243;n inicial: Si el juego de PC Civilization de Sid Meier estuviera hecho juego de cartas, ser&#237;a muy similar a &#233;ste. Tiene 3 modos de juego: B&#225;sico, Avanzado y Completo. Cada uno m&#225;s completo y m&#225;s largo, que de por si el juego ya lo es, pero a quien le guste la gesti&#243;n a tope y sensaci&#243;n de construcci&#243;n y desarrollo, le va a encantar, aunque se puede hacer bastante tediosa toda la gesti&#243;n, y eterna la partida dependiendo mucho de los gustos del jugador.  Tres a&#241;os esperando edici&#243;n en castellano, y de componentes... la edici&#243;n es car&#237;sima y muy cutre! Lo de las minipir&#225;mides es que es imperdonable, a la m&#237;nima se te mueve todo... &#172;&#172; Son demasiado peque&#241;as las casillas de puntuaciones, el dise&#241;o del tablero en ingl&#233;s est&#225; mejor. He usado piedras transparentes para marcadores de felicidad, y si puedo har&#233; sustitutos para el resto. Las ilustraciones, son horribles, cualquier ilustrador novel las har&#237;a mejor. Solo hay que ver fotos en BGG. El manual est&#225; mal estructurado, no te esperas que te cuenten las reglas "asi". El resto puede pasar, incluso me gustan los cubos de pl&#225;stico de colorines. Pero en general, es de los peores juegos calidad-precio que tengo en cuanto a dise&#241;o-componentes, pareciendo por dentro un prototipo apenas adornado. El juego en s&#237; es una pasada, s&#243;lo tiene un "fallo" gordo, muy muy largo... casi estuvimos 8h una 1a partida a 3 con novatos entre explicaci&#243;n mucho AP, etc... En fin, para aut&#233;nticos fans de los civi y con mucha mucha paciencia...  Vendido, ya que es mucho m&#225;s corto y funciona mejor online que en mesa.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">I like the game, very good theme implementation. Some of the mechanics take a while to get, and you definitely need an idea on what's in the game in total, to play even moderately successful. So consider your first game an intro, and nothing more. I think the game is quite brutal in punishing even small development inefficencies, so it might not work well to play with different levels of skill. I seldom got so frustrated in a game about getting so blasted away after seemingly doing good just three round before. Probably a bit like chess - a better opponent will always win clearly, as errors add up exponentially. Still, I want to try again.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Sweden">The game takes a ridiculously long time to play and is a little finicky with quite a bit of upkeep. It's good game though. It's like the civilization computer game without all the tedium in the late game where you spend ages moving troops. </comment>

Played 2 partial solo games and looking forward to playing 2 more games this week. Played 2 more games.  This is not a 10 for me, but it is an absolutely fantastic game.  Edit: Played this 8 times now.  Really enjoy the game.  Still want to play it.    Edit: Dropping to an 8.  I enjoy this game, but teaching it is a difficult and lengthy process.  It seems best to play 2 games in a row (1 learning and 1 regular), but that is tough to achieve.  Edit: Raising it to a 9.  Played it with the expansion.  It's long but worth the investment  Edit: Down to 7.5.  Just too long and too fiddly.  Unlikely to play more than once a year at most.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Spain">1 partida, curioso aunque al ser a 4, bastante lento y much&#237;simo AP. Habr&#237;a que probarlo con menos jugadores y sin ser el juego b&#225;sico en ese aspecto. Tenia demasiadas espectativas en este juego, que me ha decepcionado bastante, lo esperaba mucho mejor. La estragia se limita a las 5 cartas que te toquen en cada turno, que tienes que buscar el mejor combo entre ellas, que normalmente optimizarlo es s&#243;lo un camino, el terreno que salga, los dados con los simbolos de color... etc, tiene muuucho factor suerte, muy ca&#243;tico, por lo que o te encanta esto o el juego no te gusta (ameritrash puro). Como positivo, es muy variado, y el tema dia y noche esta curioso. Como an&#233;cdota, me recuerda al Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic de PC en juego de mesa</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Austria">I played this game just once, so this are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  Very interesting game. I like the idea of exploring and advancing with your character, getting allies, gaining powerful spells and fighting monsters. It may feel more like a computer game, but it's a brilliant idea! I know some other game does something similar, but this excited me the most. Furthermore the amount of game in this box is HUGE: you can play competitive, cooperative, different characters and different scenarios!   What I don't like so much are the components instead and something about the visual impact of the game feels very disorganized and chaotic. Yet this is a minor issues. The real problem I have with this game - and the reason why I cannot rate it higher - is the same I had with other games from Vlaada Chvatil: the scoring. I cannot understand them and I simply don't like them, but I also realise, that it's just my taste, and they are actually very good games.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Finland">Compared with the 1st edition the playability has been improved, especially the colouring on the map and the bigger cards. This is definitely a plus but does not justify a different rating. The rule tweaks may be in place, but this is hard to say since I won't be playing the game that much to notice the difference.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - It is the quintessential wargame. It is based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings universe and tries to follow the storyline of the book. You are in charge either of Sauron's forces or the free people (basically everyone else). In turn you recruit, move armies, engage in battles. You have the possibility to summon powerful allies known from the book. Either side must gather a number of victory points by conquering cities and strongholds. There is also an adventure game element. The free people are in control of the Fellowship, which moves secretly towards Mount Doom, if they reach it, the good guys wins. It is a rules heavy, but very in-depth strategy game, which test you distributive attention, as there are a lot of units to watch for. After you are quite familiarized with the rules the gameplay flows very neatly. It is by far one of the most epic games ever.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Canada">It took me a long time to track down this game since it was out of stock in all the shops here in Canada. I finally got it and it wasn't quite what I expected...the setup was brutal and we had to stop a ton of times for rules clarification (the rule book could be more organized), but once we got going the game ran very smoothly and definitely had a good lord of the rings vibe to it.  I'm still happy I bought it because it's a game that is best with 2 players and that's usually the number of players I get to play with. The Shadow plays a lot more straightforward...but the free folk need to be a bit more careful of what they do and when. I feel like maybe Star Wars: Rebellion would kind of replace this game on my shelf if I got it since they seem very similar in mechanics.   Cons: The game takes a VERY long time to set up compared to other games. The game is rule heavy. The tarot cards are basically 2 cards in 1 with no graphics and just a wall of text with complicated effects that you need to really understand in order to be successful.  The dice rolls force you into a particular path to victory that may not be what you wanted to do. Almost every figure in the game is blue or red. This makes things very confusing as Rohan and Gondor and the north men and so on are all pretty similar yet come into play at different times based on whatever is happening with the political track.  It's expensive (high end of the gaming spectrum, not counting ccgs and miniature games which are in a league of their own)  Pros:  There are a ton of cool figures which are decent quality. The game feels epic. It seems pretty balanced (though it is asymmetrical) The production quality of the game is good. The rules do work well and the game is pretty smooth to play once you've learned them.  If you were ever going to flip a table, this would be a great game to do it on.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="">I dont think I'd like this game as much as I do if I got to play it more often. You will make decisions that will immerse/remind you of the source material.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Finland">Thanks a lot FFG for yet another crappy rulebook. Sure, it is true that the system has been streamlined from previous generations of dungeon crawlers (Descent and Doom), but the way it is presented to the players is rubbish. The rulebook has an onion structure distributing all essential information of a rather simple game over tens of pages.  Another weak point is the infinite levels of pain the setup induces. Sure the game is beautiful but the search for the right bits and pieces is a quest of abysmal frustration. Oh why could not you just make a pile of generic pieces instead of individual ones.  In the end we got sick and tired of the setup and trying to find the information we needed. Without giving it further thought we covered the gaps in the rules with our own and quickly grabbed a bunch of troops and cards to play with. Once the game finally started, it shone like only a star could. Take my word with a grain of salt though. After all those brain burners, a fast paced dice fest always welcome to my table. I do not mind if the game does not offer the cleverest of mechanics as long as offers a retreat to another universe.  If you fancy a game calling for deep thinking, skip this one. You will just ruin the experience with your analysis. But should you enjoy quick decisions based only on your intuition, you might find Star Wars Imperial assault a rather refreshing experience.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Switzerland">What i like: - good theme - The new rule to bring dead units (I hate that system in descent) - the new alternance sequence in play's turn (instread of all unit of one faction and then all the unit of the other)  What i don't like: - it's long, it's so loooong - alpha player syndrome - the map, still small and ugly</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">Love the theme.  Game play doesn't necessarily hold up but don't mind playing given the theme.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">1st plays: This is a refined version of the Descent 2.0 system with a better theme.  I really wanted to like Descent, but the hand of take-that cards always felt jarring, and the long turns caused it to drag a bit.  Threaded actions and less gotcha's speed up the game and make for a positive experience.  I do wish there were more Jedi/Sith though.  2nd plays: We played this multiple times in one night, and the campaign was interesting, each scenario was different, and not quite the frantic pace of Descent.  It's still a race to complete objectives, but slightly less so, and still a very tight margin for error.</comment>

Basic competence tends to be rare, so when it happens I'm surprised. In the case of IA, that's about where it stands for me. It's competently made, a good system. There's nothing standout, besides the SW theme if that's what you're into.</comment>

We'll see how this changes after a few more playthroughs and at diff player counts, but I found the game went way too quickly and was pretty anticlimactic.  Maybe I was just expecting too much given the hype and long wait for this... My husband enjoyed it quite a bit.</comment>

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United Kingdom">Blood Rage is at heart a streamlining of Lang's earlier Chaos in the Old World with the action transferred to a world of Norse mythology. The competing Viking clans are undifferentiated at the start, but gradually grow more asymmetric through the drafting of upgrades.  The game is less about area control than its forefather; only drafted quest cards reward it.  The focus has switched to winning battles, progressing along three tracks and sending souls to Valhalla.  Some card combos do seem very powerful and there is less variety in the cards than I'd have hoped (a consequence of streamlining?).  All the same, it plays quite smoothly, the tight limits on area occupancy reward forward planning, and the shrinking play area ensures plenty of conflict.  I like the artwork and the minis are very good indeed. The one misstep is the clan of chainmail bikini clad Viking babes.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United Kingdom">A game about battling Vikings is something I'm predisposed to be lukewarm about. I don't like direct conflict games, especially of the dice chucking, conquest and fighting over territory variety. Blood Rage is none of those things. It's not even really about Vikings but rather a fantasy Norse mythology world. The game is essentially a euro where you draft cards in order to build combos and point-gaining engines, and then tactically move around pieces on a limited map to gain said points. Fighting is better described as "area majority" and often you don't even want to win. Might be a little too chaotic and random for my liking (and I'm usually fond of a healthy dose of both). The main downside is that if (like me) you don't care about miniatures, the minis make the game far more expensive than I'd normally want to pay for a game like this.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="">Fun battle game... really nice miniatures!!  </comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United Kingdom">Splendid game for those who don't want to "build civilizations", "save the princess" or "deliver goods to another area", but prefer slaughter and pillaging! If that's you, Blood Rage comes to your aid, with very easy to understand logic but enough variety of cards/choice of action to make the game exciting. Great artwork on the cards and game board, and absolutely gorgeous minis (I've just done 2 clans and some monsters). If you are into painting the figures and are good at it, you'll have a work  of art game. It's not too complex to exasperate a player yet not too simple, it's just right. Not surprised at all that it was made by teh same guy who did my favourite Chaos in the Old World.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Italy">Power Grid is, at its core, an accounting exercise, but, as strange as it might sound, it can be a *fun* accounting exercise. You have to optimize your energy production through a careful choice of the power plants you want to run, taking into consideration their power output, their cost (you have to bid for them) and the resources it takes to run them. Throw in a nice economical system for resource pricing, a bit of positional play when you choose the cities you supply with electricity and that's almost it. Not exactly a gateway game, rules are functional but somewhat fiddly and it can be quite long, but it also offers interesting decisions and just a bit of luck. It can feel dry and I don&#8217;t consider it a game for every crowd, but it surely deserves at least a try.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">Great game. Wish I could get it to the table more often.  UPDATED 5-28-14: Bumped it down to a 7 from an 8. Still like this game, but we have noticed that, at least in a 2 player game, the last round is absent of any surprise element once the bidding phase is over. You know exactly how many cities you can power as well as your opponent, and so at that point if one person has the advantage, the game is over.  UPDATE 6-17-15: Traded with Power Grid for Smash Up in Dice Tower Con Math Trade.</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">This is an economic efficiency game. I love the theme and the cartoony artwork (I work in the nuclear power industry), and the game is fun. It has simple rules, is easy to learn, and scales great with any number of players. I usually don't care for efficiency exercises, but I think the modern setting and theme make it more interesting for me.  The game does tend to get pretty mathy and analytical, though, which can be undesirable depending on my mood. The last turn tends to bog down as everyone starts really thinking about their every expenditure and counting everything, as that last turn is the one that really counts. It's one of the better Eurogames, but I'm usually in the mood for a game with more craziness and less math.</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="">A good game with one of the best catch-up mechanics I've seen. At the same time, my experiences have varied greatly depending on the gaming group. I wouldn't recommend playing this with 6 players. The 5 player version is quite enjoyable if people don't care forever to decide where to place their cities. So, in short, 8 with the right group, but perhaps 6 or 7 otherwise. </comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">I love the resource economy here, awesome game mechanics. I don't like having the ability to know who won two turns before the game actually ends as a result of mental computations used by experienced players.

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">Superlative. It truly deserves the rank on the 'Geek. There's a few odd moments in the rules, but when you play, it's butter. My only take back from that is the computational energy needed to play - great computing minds will likely win the day. And this in turn falls into somewhat of a 'sameness' to play. For a mathy game - a genre I generally dislike - I find it surprisingly fun.</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">For a 4X game, I can't think of anything more to ask. It is extremely well made - in design and mechanics. It all plays like butter. However, yes indeed those missiles ruin combat. Seems like a large oversight only because the rest of the game is polished to a super-nova gleam. My largest take away is the score tile pulls which can literally swing an entire game away. It seems apparent unless you live by the sword and attack alot (thus getting alot of grabs in the bag for good VP tiles), you cannot possibly win. That the game makes you believe you *could* win without combat speaks volumes to the great design. Good game.</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United Kingdom">The good news is, it is the game that Space Empires should have been. And the bad news is its more expensive and got published second [and Space Empires XXXX was 20 years in the making...damn!]. We played six-player and I'm not sure that worked as well as a smaller number might. Its simple, and therefore may be good for a few plays before you turn to other Essen releases. The main variations are travel possibilities between tiles and the selections of technology tiles that are available each turn, which are concerned with warship operation and production, but of course you buy whatever is available that you can afford. So the choice is limited, even if you go first.  The trouble with simplicity is that its no friend to radical novelty, and here there are a few old clich&#233;s:  you can't fight more than one war, onesuch will bankrupt you, and the enemy can build new ships in beleaguered systems. Yawn. </comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Germany">Impressive design, but fiddly. It seems difficult to follow all players' action attentively (from across the table especially), and apparently the game is prone to inducing tiny little mistakes, tactical as well as ruleswise. Looking forward to playing some more. </comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">After watching it at the BGG, I played my first game, and lost badly. I tried to explore backwards, and in the second round all my forward options were grabbed by someone else, so I found myself locked in. All remaining explorations got no tiles that allowed me to connect back, so I was stuck with limited resources; no chance ever. I still liked it, and want to play again.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United Kingdom">A very nice streamlined play and tech/ship levelling that fits together nicely, very keen to get this to the table some more and explore the advanced races. 4X is a tempting theme for me and with the fresher mechanics making it more like a crossbreed with something like Through the Ages (one of my all time favourites) this feels like it will be here to stay but I make this assumption about a lot of games before I play them to death. </comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">I've played this game now twice with two players and once with three, so no diplomacy rules.  I love the theme and enjoy playing the game, but I wonder about the two player game.  In our three games we've had only one player vs player battle (the 3 player game) and we're generally aggressive players.  We'll definitely play it again, so a success.</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Austria">Eclipse is a good game and a missed 10 for me, since this game has a lot of great ideas and mechanisms, but I've really a problem with some of its aspects. I love the technologies, the possibility to customize the spaceships and the different powers of the alien races. The components are great and the artwork is excellent! I like the different strategies, the action selection mechanism and the combat resolution.  What brings this game down to be "just" a good game is basically a combination of rules that I don't like. The bag is the first one, because I think it's a very stupid way to determine the points you receive from a battle. It doesn't makes sense at all and it just adds unnecessary and negative randomness to the game, that can cause significant point swings. I also have a problem with the exploration, because you can get some bad random tiles and find yourself simply behind the others for that only. I know that you are supposed to fight for the best tiles, but it still bothers me that someone can jump ahead just because he/she was lucky enough to find the good ones.  Eclipse could have been the game I was searching for as a 4X game, but - for these issues - it's "just" a medium-good game that failed to be awesome for me. I still enjoy it, but I'm a little annoyed by some simply strange rules.</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="">Very good game. However, the amount of setup and steep learning curve sometimes makes it difficult to find the motivation to play.

Although it's annoying at first speaking about R&amp;D and Archives, it does add to the atmosphere of the game.  Good mechanics and the bluffing and risk calculation makes it a bit unique. It can get expensive if you want to play competitively, although never to the lengths of magic.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Really like this one, and played constantly for about 6 months with a coworker. Runner vs corp asymmetry works very well. Moved states, and can't find a new opponent, so it'll probably be shelved for a while, as I don't really want to play online.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="">You will need more than one core sets. You will need many expansions for competitive play, to build better decks. Its snowballing out and the expansions are not balanced, meaning you cant win Competitions just with one Core Set and wthout expansions. Decks with expansions will be stronger for shure. (Jackson Howard, i am looking at you)  Otherwise a very solid game and what i like most about it is the asymmetrical setup. I like the deck building mechanic and most things other people love about the game too. But the expansion madness is a big minus.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">A very cool and pretty unique theme with great looking cards.  One player plays the evil corporation trying to implement agendas and the other player plays a "runner" -- sort a computer hacker -- who tries to invade the servers, break through the defenses, and steal the agendas.  Not really a good guy in this.  Fun system and very hip.  Being a living card game instead of a collectible card game increases this rating by about 6 points.</comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Singapore">Android Netrunner is a game that did the impossible in my mind. It made me say there was a card game that surpassed Magic the Gathering for me even when I was trying to keep Magic as my top card game. It's asymmetrical play is totally unique as of now for such games and the Poker element of bluff and bait is much more involved than any other card game, meaning looking at your opponent and his body tendencies are a element of play too.   Downside is it is harder to learn than the other card games as to the asymmetrical factions and cost long run for a successful LCG game like Netrunner can become expensive to keep up with the competitive curve and buy all the new cards. </comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Australia">I am attracted to the look and feel of this game. I loved NEUROMANCER and am drawn to both conceptions of 'living' in cyberspace and the tension between the goals of corporations and those of hackers. Although the FFG aesthetic is a bit cartoonish, it still carries enough of the tropes of cyberpunk for me to want to invest in the game.   Unfortunately, the mechanics kill it for me. As a system, I think the underlying action-point structure nicely marries some of the aesthetics of the genre. It's balanced enough as you feel like you have options but aren't sure if you are being efficient enough until you know what your opponent is trying to do. Unfortunately, instead of making a complete game, you have to continually buy cards from FFG to keep up with the metagame.   The overall dynamic means the game plays you. If you play this at the competitive level you must continually pay to play decks that give you a chance. If you play this casually you will eventually fall into rote strategies in known matchups. I don't see a meaningful difference between the meta-dynamics of this game and Collectable Card Games. Intellectually, you are chasing your tail, and financially, you are a sucker.    I don't think you should buy this game. As someone who played A LOT of tournament [thing=463][/thing] and [thing=13293][/thing], the LCG model destroys games by making them cost several hundred dollars and an arms race played out as a series of 'take that' deck construction surprises.   I'D RATHER WE PLAYED: [thing=43022][/thing]. You pay upfront for a complete game and can master a character over time. The relationship between bluffing and valuation is more fluid and personal to the players.</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="">Nice little game. Almost feels like two games in one, with how different the roles are.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">A very enjoyable party style game with very simplistic rules. A ton of variation makes this game have a large amount of replay value. </comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">While there is a good bit of downtime between turns, the game has some fun and interesting wordplay/connections going on.  When playing, we had the opposing team score the words right or wrong because that seemed to help lessen the odds of accidentally giving information away to the other team.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Lots of hype for this game, maybe even over hyped? Because of this I was left a little disappointed after my first play. It's not a laugh out loud shout at everyone party game. This is just a plain super solid word game that will likely get more time at the table than any of my other games because of its accessibility to all gamers.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="">I think a slightly better set of words would facilitate more fun games. Would like to try with minimum clue numbers.</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Poland">2016-06-23 (rating 7.5):  A nice alternative to [gameid=39856]. Somewhat more interesting I think. But still I think this game got too much hype.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Turns out it is more fun to be the spymaster than the guesser, that is what is keeping me interested with this game at the moment. This game has just exploded! recently (2016) and while their success is nice to see, I personally feel it is a little overblown. It's accessible to all and that counts.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">9 plays / 6,7,8 players  LIKE: Solid game, easy to learn. Good variation between plays. DISLIKE: Rules of silence are important and inadvertently broken. Game is a bit light and needs the right group.  OVERALL: Fun game for a group, because the team aspect creates that tension and interesting dynamics. I don't think it'd be as fun with less than 6.</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Finland">I do not know which is more fun, playing the spymaster given hints or trying to figure out the clues. Either way Codenames is entertaining. The only worry I have about the game is the possibility for serious analysis paralysis with some players if they just cannot make up good hints. Fortunately the publisher has supplied the players with an hourglass to keep the pace fast.  Anyways, Codenames certainly lives to its rating offering superb party fun for the early evening when the going is not too crazy. </comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">What's this?  A party game that is enjoyable?  Yes, sir!  This one can be really dependent on the base intelligence of the group you are playing with.  Smart people can come up with some remarkably clever clues (even though they are only one word!) that are a thing of beauty, based on references to history, literature, etc.  Other groups?  I could see this falling flat (unless there happens to be that one time where the clue giver could say, "Animals, 4" and have all of the animal words conveniently lined up).   </comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Fun word / party game.  Can be tough as the spymaster but a good rush when you can build your clues up so that your team is able to get 3-4 cards at once to win you the game.  Be careful about the assassin and knowing your team.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Quite fun, clever, new party game.  The rules are perfect, and the play is streamlined and short!  I think it might be tough with more than 6, due to the opposite seating.  Not a slam-dunk on entertainment, but I can see this one growing on me.</comment>

This would be infinitely better to the other games we play in bigger groups.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Wales">I think there's a lot to explore here (no pun intended). It offers something truly thematic, whilst utilising many of the Euro-mechanics I am always drawn towards in a game. The production is of a high quality, but the rulebook is terrible.  I traded this away. It's a good game, but it suffers from the same "problem" as D-Day Dice. Unless you invest time in playing through the scenarios in sequence with the same players over and over (or play solitaire), you never get the opportunity to move on past Scenario 1 or 2. I play a lot with new players, so this sort of game doesn't suit me well.  Traded for Catacombs with 2 expansions, and no regrets.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Germany">I love coop-games. Robinson Crusoe feels different. That the game somehow reacts to your actions by clever resolving of event cards is really neat. Also the text in italics tells a nice story. The decision to take risks or not is very difficult at some times. There are 6 scenarios which come with the base game but for sure this leaves a lot of content to develop for future expansions or fan made scenarios. The mechanics work smoothly and the game seems to be quiet challenging which isnt always granted in a coop-game.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Netherlands">Could easily be an 8 if the rules were not so convoluted and I didn't have to go through a 50 pages long F.A.Q before I understand how to play it...Too many little rules...</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Singapore">A rare game that has both strategic value and theme.  Limiting factor is the gamer who tells everyone what to do can be a problem. But overall, makes you feel like the theme suggests and each decision is crucial to winning this hard game. I do not have enough thumbs up for this to do the game justice.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">A solid coop.  Interesting-ish with the limited options and inherent tech tree and different scenarios, but really boils down to your usual worker placement coop.  Theme is excellent and well-reflected.  I misread one scenario as The Island of Cannabis (instead of Cannibals).  A great game but I'm not sure what, if anything, new it brings to the table.  Still, check it out - it works well and looks nice.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Canada">It's a beautiful game with well integrated mechanics, especially in the adventure decks that get shuffled into events. I'm not certain it beats out other co-op games for me, but it's an uplifting alternative with easily tweaked difficulty settings. The game suffers from the illusion of choice; if you don't have enough food then you obviously go harvest or hunt. If you haven't built a level 3 or 4 roof and you'll roll two weather dice, you obviously focus on that. If you don't have one of the two +1 production tokens you obviously go for that. The engine building is really mundane in that way by punishing any choice that isn't one of the one or two optimal moves (regardless of whether you succeed or not).</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Interesting thematic co-op!  I appreciate how bits and pieces of it work nicely to make a thematic experience, and I think the game as a whole is well-designed, but there are a bunch of little oddities - the fiddliness is pretty major, for one.  Also, the different types of beast attacks and limited hunting deck (and the death iguana!) are somewhat weird.  It's a good game, but I've found that the experience isn't as clean as, say, Eldritch Horror and the puzzle isn't as interesting as Ghost Stories.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">I would rate this higher if not for all of the finicky building restrictions.  Seperate requirements for iron and coal seemed unnecessary.  Overall, a great resource management game.  I was slightly put off by how restricted you can be by the cards you draw, and generally how much more valuable a card like "Liverpool" is compared to "Burnley".    </comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">I should say, 90% of my Brass plays have been with 2 people (using the suggested 2-player variant on BGG). I will say that the game is good, it does fit several of my preferred board game mechanics. However, my judgment of Brass is not very well rounded, based on mostly using the 2-player variant. That said, the game might be better if it only took an 1 hour, instead of 2. </comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">Really nice game, but not easy to build a winning strategy. Each time I think I understood the mechanics, I loose again.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">+ Every decision has implications for the rest of the game; Shockingly deep strategy that needs to be adapted for the given scenario makes for a brain-burning good time. - Long and dense games are definitely not for everyone.   Why it's previously-owned: While I enjoy long and admittedly-tedious economic games, I don't have a lot of friends who do as well.  Since I like other games with more flash than this one, I expect that we'll play those ones instead and this one would have just collected dust.   This got traded for Dune CCG.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Netherlands">I love the theme and the mechanics are fresh enough. The cards dictate strategy, but there are always enough options open. There are never enough actions to do what you want, which makes the game exciting. The rules are not as intuitive as I would have liked. The best strategic option does not always correspond to the theme, which is unfortunate.</comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">1 play / 3 players  LIKE: An enormous amount of unique cards and the cards are thematically fun, from asteroids to amoebas. Lots of combos to discover, and a possibility to build a big engine. Some interaction when racing towards objectives before others, creating some tension. I liked hanging on to powerful cards that could be used later.  DISLIKE: Iconography overload and tiny text on cards. It took me a while to understand the flow of the game. It takes one entire play to digest the different cards and how they work together. Difficult to directly slow another player down.  OVERALL: A fun card-driven, engine building game. Sifting through cards and trying to figure out combos is the game. The more you know the cards, the better you do. The game keeps my interest for now.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Not sure what all the hype is about this game. The VP conditions seem so arbitrary like 1VP for every Forrest and every Forrest that touches one of your cities.   Second major problem is the sheer magnitude of cards (and associated card text) and the luck of the draw. One player got a 2VP card that only needed 11 gold and other cards seemed much weaker. I'd be curious to get an analysis of the cards and see how people think about card draw variability.  Played two additional times and with the drafting variant it got better.  With experienced players, the gameplay time is reduced significantly (very good analogy is Race for the Galaxy).  Intrigued to play this more.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Spain">Es muy buen juego, me gusta los combos que puedes llegar a hacer con las carta, la construcci&#243;n de losetas y los par&#225;metros de ox&#237;geno, temperatura y oc&#233;anos.

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Obviously, I have to take a few tenths of a point off for bad component quality, but otherwise a fantastic game. Almost every game ends with all players being very nervous for the game end. I also find it very satisfying to see how the planet progresses over the game play. The fact that it's card driven is cool, but I'd love to see several card expansions for more re-playability.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Solid game with a few rough edges: 1) For a relatively long game, card draw plays too prominent a part with too few ways to mitigate by increased drawing. 2) Take-that cards are annoying -- too few to really cause chaos and none that really slow down a leader (assuming the leader, if that can even be determined, is targeted in the first place). 3) Average component quality with player boards that are thin paper and can easily be bumped, knocking the myriad of cubes around.  Going to play again with the card draft to see if that helps.  UPDATE 11/6/16: Card draw is a must -- definitely improves the game.  Still leaving it at a 7 but could rise with further plays.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Canada">A worker placement game with a great unique mechanic (gears), and simple options but tough decisions.  Set in the time of the Mayans, this is yet another worker placement game(!), however this time, there are actually some nice new aspects combined with tried and true mechanics.  Your goal is to of course, accumulate the most points by the end of the game, and there are 2 in-game scoring rounds, and a final scoring.  On your turn, your choices appear simple: 1)place a worker(s), or 2) take back a worker(s).  You CANNOT do both even though many times you want to.  Your placements are on moving gears, of which there are 5 of (with a central gear that moves them all), and the longer you leave your worker, the better the payoff.  However, you will need to take them off on occasion simply because you have no more to place- also if you wait too long, they will get nothing.  As well, you have several workers, but the more you place, the more expensive it gets.    The gears provide: 1) resources (wood) and food/currency (corn), 2) better but more scarce resources (wood, stone, gold, skulls), 3) ability upgrades and construction/buildings and temple sacrifices, 4) more workers and flexible options to use currency, and 5) big point generators where you place skulls.  There are 4 checkpoints in the game where you either score points or collect resources IF you've been good to the gods, and where you have to feed your workers (or lose points like Agricola).  There are several different paths here, you can go crazy building buildings which generate points and give small bonuses and abilities, you can go for skulls which provide big points, you can go heavy on sacrifices for the gods which pay out points 3 times during the game, you can do a bit of everything.  The theme works, and the game scales very well (2-players works great despite the seeding of initial dummy players/blocks).  The gear mechanic looks and plays great, very impressive component implementation.

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">1 play / 4 players  LIKE: Many many options. Waiting longer to take an action using the big gears, is different and enjoyable than other games. The crystal skull resource token is pretty. DISLIKE: Overwhelming with the number of paths, but the expansion helps give direction with asynchronous powers. Minimal player interaction.  OVERALL: Solid game, I can see why it is well liked. I wish there was a touch more interaction, but I think competing for the different spots is still a good amount. The tension is there.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Finland">The designers must have been drunk when they've got the idea for this game. "How can we enhance rondel? I know, let's have five of them." But I have to give credit to the designers because the game simply works and book keeping tasks are kept to minimum. The mechanic feels fresh, too, which is always welcome in this genre.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Germany">I really enjoyed the worker placement system in this game. Its really something new out of the often chosen mechanic. After 1 game it feels that there are so many ways to win this game and so many choices that I was quite happy. The bad combos will be developed after 3 - 4 games I guess.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Very cool point-salad type game with a very neat timing structure for placement or dis-placement of workers on the gear segments.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Another clever game with too much stuff going on.  It's very complicated to explain the rules...very simple play mechanics...and yet very difficult and taxing decisions.  I almost wanted a notepad to program possible moves, because I could barely remember what I needed to do when.  I probably don't need to own a copy, as it's too deep for me to keep.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Netherlands">I like the gear mechanisms but it's a worker placement-driven game hence the lower rating </comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Worker placement with future planning plus a multitude of paths and a side serving of feed your people.  The cog mechanism is the big draw (it's so... big!), but you'll stay for the depth.  There's so much going on it'll take a few plays to appreciate the diversity, but it's there.  Still, not my favorite, largely because it's all in the future planning/timing.  So much of the game is wrapped up in it that it overshadows the otherwise pleasant diversity - it *is* the game.  And that's not my favorite.  But a really cool game all the same.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Spain">Good worker placement game. It is not groundbreaking but everything works and the wheels make the game different and memorable. I do not mind to play it once in a while.</comment>

I like the mechanic, and the unique usage of workers.  I don't know how well this game will hold up to repeat plays, and I think the theme could have been more fun, but it's a solid euro so far.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Singapore">Obviously a worker placement game with a mobile twist.  Innovative dial movement, and beautiful components and overall presentation.  ultimately, it's a grab resource for VP game.   Initial game rating.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">2-4(4)  The worker placement system is fine enough, but ultimately pretty standard. Really, it's just a form of promoting your placed workers each turn. The gears are just a means of doing that promotion, while also being visually cool.  That's fine. I suppose the big thing about this should be that you can only place or remove workers (and placing costs money based on how many you place). Which leads to some serious planning so that you can consolidate your turns (and not be removing multiple turns in a row, or that you have the resources to execute when you remove).  Another of those games where half the board won't be loaded up by game end (some skulls will be empty, several cult tracks won't be advanced, technologies will not be upgraded, etc.), and thus ultimately sort of just a game to specialize as best you can in certain domains.  Fun enough, but I think others of this oeuvre are more interesting to me, overall.</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Quite innovative game play.  Essentially a choose-your-own-adventure story in co-op game form.  I'm not a fan of how you really have to "play to lose" 1 or 2 games first before you can "solve" the game.  And I don't like memory elements in games.  Those aside, this was quite an experience: a fun way to spend the evening with friends...even though you only get to play it once.  I love how they made this "expandable."  Almost creates a new sub-genre of games.</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="">Very enjoyable, but also not much of a game. I would liken it more to something like a mystery dinner/interactive theater sort of deal where you're not quite sure where this is going, and you're part of the crank that moves the story forward. And that's a good and enjoyable thing. By all means, I recommend it. But it feels a bit odd to rank it alongside The Golden Ages or Hive. From a mechanical/game perspective, it's effectively a 5. There's some knobs to push and dials to turn, but almost everything you're doing is just brute force. It's not very interesting, as a game. As an experience, it's quite fun. Though, you can only have that experience once, and then you have to buy a new cartridge.  So basically, take this as a ranking of enjoyability rather than as a game.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Germany">I did not like the Asylum scenario much. Under the mask and Marcy case are much better. Have not finished Dragon prophecy yet.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Hmm. Quite interesting. Wife and I liked exploring the Asylum quite a bit. I did have a few negatives - the rules are a bit unclear at points. Combining that with the fear of reading spoilers, I didn't want to go to the FAQ to get answers, but we figured it out. I'm not sure I would buy this game - but this is a perfect "borrow" or "rent" from a friend game.  Regarding Asylum... (spoilers, I guess). Don't know how I would have figured out the Pentacle clue, but I'm terrible at that sort of thing. I was quite surprised the first time we found a creature that was clearly not human - I was expecting all the terror and horror to be psychological - not actual. I also wish we had more time to explore and see things. The two dead ends were quite amazing - one clearly going to be a dead end, one caught me by extreme surprise.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Enjoyable.  I'm not sure I quite get the craze, but I did have fun.  My desire to get the expansions is neither here nor there, but my spouse very much wants them.</comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">7-29-2014: It's an okay worker placement, resource management game. Not bad, but not great either. Take it or leave it.  Kickstarted - Available November 2015</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Belgium">Interesting mix of mechanics, but plenty of downtime and huge point salad</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Wales">My only previous experience with the Key games is from playing Keythedral. Keyflower is considerably heavier than that title. The rules-explanation is long, and the central concepts here are not particularly familiar from other titles, hence it isn't always intuitive. But Keyflower works brilliantly. It is clever, strategic and interactive, with just a touch of the mean-ness of Keythedral. The artwork is sublime, and the components are great. There is a lot of variety provided too, with different tiles available in different game, and variable scoring conditions. This is an excellent new take on the worker-placement, and pick-up-and-deliver genres.</comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Denmark">Fun game for the family!</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Finland">Very unique mechanics for the market, bidding and worker placement. Introduces fresh air into the genre. You are constantly thinking of trade-offs between this and that which is a sign of a good game. Personally I did not find the victory point generation mechanics that interesting. You are either upgrading tiles, moving resources onto certain tiles or collecting sets. Ok, this is basic stuff in board games but for some reason it felt a little bit detached in this context. Maybe it was the fact that acquiring tiles is not enough but you have to commit energy to make use of them. This slows the game down a little bit, especially on the first plays when you do not know what should you be aiming at. Moreover, it takes a lot of experience to see the value of each tile since you actually must be able to use them to unleash their potential.  I would call Keyflower a light gamer's game. There is no way could imagine teaching this to my non-gamer friends. The basic mechanics are so mind boggling at first that less experienced gamers will have hard time understanding the game. Yet they are rather simple once you have them figured out. It has to be mentioned though, that the rulebook plays its part in this initial complexity. The way the rules are written does a terrific job at explaining the rules but for some reason it is harder to understand how the game actually plays.  Keyflower definitely has potential for a higher rating than a seven. Time will tell.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United Kingdom">When I first played Keyflower I thought it had some fantastically unique mechanics and was a great game packed with tight decisions.  However, the more I play the more I think it's just a little too random for the 4 turn game that it is.  When you see scores of 70ish points and you can gain/lose 15 points based on pulling a red meeple instead of a blue or you can score 30 points if the right autumn tile comes out but 10 if not, it's a bit dissatisfying to think I did the best I could with what I had but just didn't get what I really needed which is a shame. Maybe it's better with more players when there's less variation in tiles but still, I'm not convinced.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">This is apparently the 7th installment by R&amp;D games for games in a setting known as "Key Land" which I like to think of as a theme park for locksmiths. "Unfamiliar to me" setting aside, there are a lot of interesting things going on in this game. Familiar mechanics are played in unfamiliar and novel ways. For instance, you spend the course of four seasons bidding on flops of tiles which you use to assemble your personal village. You don't bid with money though, you bid with meeples. The different colors must be matched and the quantity exceeded when bidding for a tile, so one blue meeple must be outbid by 2 blue meeples and so on. As you build your village, you want to use it to do things BUT other players can use it too so things can get tricky. Say for example you build a good engine, and another player sees it, well instead of trying to stop you they just decide to use your engine! Now this isn't a complete block, but in order to use a tile after someone else does, you again have to place extra meeples of the same color on the tile. What color meeples people have are secret so you may or may not be blocked when people do this to you and it is a part of the strategy in the game as well. These are just a few examples of mechanics that you thought you had seen done before executed differently. I really like this game and may have to check out other games in this, "Key Land".</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="">I have a hard time giving a good introduction to this. That I find only drawback. Not a hard game but slightly tricky to introduce.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Quite a good Key game.  There's complexity, but you don't play with all the tiles at a time, so you can ease yourself into it.  There are very few rounds, but they last a long time as you agonize over your decisions...like a Wallace game.  Fun engine building!</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Spain">Very good impression after 1 game. Easy and engaging bidding system + resource management + a hint of network development. All good elements.</comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">I like the aesthetics of Keyflower and the auctioning of tiles to expand your settlement area works nicely. I think it's a good, solid design (lots of familiar mechanics with a new flavor)--but something about it doesn't quite excite me as much as other similar games. The replay value seems good because you don't get to see all the tiles every game, but the combos you can build are just okay. I think that might be the piece missing for me--more interesting tile interactions.</comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">Fun, but very short, maybe too short.  There seem to be many strategies to follow, but its hard to say which is best, or if it depends too much on what the other players are doing/passing you.  Draft mechanic is interesting.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="Denmark">This really needs more plays. It is rather easy to learn and plays quite fast as well. But we have most often played it two (the play count is quite off), and while we actually like the dummy player, it gets a bit old. We have played it with more once or twice, and we enjoyed it quite a bit more.  But now we don't want to bring it to the table when it is just the two of us, and we have more interesting games for 4p+.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="Canada">Card-drafting civilization building that scales very well and plays quickly.  I can see why people love this game; it plays quick, it has replayability, and it can accomodate 2-7 players (!), plus the theme "fits".  I'm not sure it has much in the way of strategy or control, but again because of the short playtime this is tolerable I guess (any game with card-drafting as the central mechanic seems tactical at best).  Setup/space is a bit of a pain in the ass, considering its a quick card game, so you almost have to have a big table and play several games back-to-back for it to be worth it.  2-player is a bit annoying for this very reason(s); that said, the "dummy" mechanic, which I usually do not enjoy at all, is implemented pretty well.  The cost and box-size/shelf-space is a bit absurd, when you compare it to say, oh Dominion.  This game also seems very expandable, and the Leaders expansion seems to be a must buy for me.  And oh, this is really a very very simple game to jump in and play, despite what the simpleton SdJ jury voters might lead you to believe.  Own the [boardgame=92539]Leaders[/boardgame], [boardgame=111661]Cities[/boardgame], [boardgame=154638]Babel[/boardgame] and [boardgame=133993]Wonder Pack[/boardgame] expansions, as well as the [boardgame=110308]Catan[/boardgame], [boardgame=83445]Manneken Pis[/boardgame], [boardgame=99315]Stevie[/boardgame], [boardgame=127838]Louis[/boardgame], [boardgame=156119]Wil[/boardgame] and [boardgame=166329]Nimrod[/boardgame] promos.  This expansion (Leaders) adds another round of drafting, which leaves you with a hand of 4 leaders, 3 of which can be played during the course of the game.  The leaders allow for specialization/ways to score points/quick money etc., and add to the gameplay.  Really a simple addition and a must-have expansion for fans of 7 Wonders.</comment>

That being said, having a Main Objective, a Secret Objective, and a Crisis to think about every round is overwhelming.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">First play a month ago, and I loved it! Will need a few more plays to see if it holds it ranking, but I love how we're all in this difficult scenario together, but each have our own secret agenda - brilliant take on the co-op genre. And there's even the possibility of a traitor, aka BSG. Makes everyone paranoid, perfect for our backstabbing group!</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Fun game and highly thematic.  I feel that the difficulty is highly dependent on there being a traitor though.  As in it is too easy to win with no traitor on the regular difficulty but too hard to win with a traitor on the higher difficulty.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">It's a pretty cool experience, overall.  Almost a little too close to Ameritrash to me, but it has some Euro sensibilities.  The "crossroads" eventing makes this game what it is.  Game mechanics are a 6, but the theme-ing makes it a 7.</comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Another game that both my brothers own.  A well-constructed game, but not my cup of tea.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United Kingdom">Rating based on one turn-based game on BGA (which remains unfinished after 2 months!), so might not be a fair rating yet.   Getting anything done feels very arduous and convoluted. Will probably have a rules refresher after this game and play again in real time to get a better feel for it. Still, I can't see this being one we pick up, I just want to give it a fair trial.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">I think the only problem with this game is that, given the incremental nature of it and the similarities between each turn, a more experienced player will simply stomp on newer players each and every turn. It's not a runaway leader problem, but it can be disheartening to simply be unable to do anything meaningful due to the overwhelming amount of stuff going on.</comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">This Christmas, Caylus picked up where Settlers of Catan left off, pulling some non-game-playing friends a little further into the Euro game genre. We played our first two games on Christmas Eve, with two or three more planned for tonight.  August 2012 update: nobody in my group ever wants to play it. They say it's dry. :/</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">I like Caylus but I have a few games I would rather play that scratch the same itch for me. It is a fun game though and I would not likely turn down a chance to play. </comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">after two plays. 1 3-player, 1 5-player. really liked the progressive scoring and lots and lots of options. HATED the coalition building that happened occasionally, it was such a small part of the game but could have such a big impact, led to king-making and a bad feeling all-around. </comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Wow. Someone in the family expressed amazement at no dice. Incredible game that seems to separate the in-depth gamers from the "whoa, this is over-the-top" gamers.  [Ahhh, my first game of the on-going present gaming age. The entry was among my earliest upon joining da 'geek in Spring '07.]</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Canada">A somewhat dry worker placement game, it also has very tight strategy and lots of difficult and interesting decisions to make.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Hmmm... a good game, but for me it's not as revolutionary as some might say. I'm definitely interested in playing more, so it's a good sign. I'll leave it at that for now.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Canada">Finally got to play this classic. There is a lot going on and I wouldn't mind  to trying it again.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Rather complicated in really just one way: there are alot of buildings with a variety of costs and implications. So each turn is truly full of options - and that can make for slow play. Still, very tasty in the amount of options each turn - lots of paths to try out. Additional plays continue to show this game to be very good indeed.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Caylus was far from the first worker placement game I've played, but even without a sense of novelty, I can see why it's considered a classic. Multiple paths to victory, lots of difficult decisions, and repeated plays are rewarded with better performances. I've only played the game with two players, and while it's still great fun, I suspect it's even better with more players. </comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">At one point I viewed this as the successor to Puerto Rico, but it's a different game. I'd probably rate it higher if I didn't think Caylus Magna Carta captures the essence of the game in a much shorter time period.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Just don't play with an over-analyzer. And don't be one!</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United Kingdom">You gets the wood, you builds the hut. you gets the stone, you builds the castle.  Sold my copy - great game but just too long to get regular play</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Quite fun for the first and second playthroughdue to the added emphasis on strategy, but the complete lack of randomness does eventually stale the game, since playthroughs start to seem similar.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Italy">Nice original game but a little boring.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">I prefer Le Havre and Agricola to Caylus.  However, I like original Caylus better than the watered down Caylus Magna Carta.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Canada">Extremely well balanced game. The provost/bridge is a little to cutthroat; I find people rarely move it because its such an aggressive play in an otherwise fairly friendly game. Sucks to have to pass the tiles around to see what's available for purchase. A little light on the player interaction overall.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Canada">Very thinly themed game occurring in a time period when the French were fighting the 100 year war.  What makes this game work is the variability, the unique "bag building" mechanic, and the ease of play.  The game occurs over 18 rounds, which sounds like a lot but actually plays very quickly.  Each round, the following happens: 1) flip a random event (very similar to Pillars of the Earth where some are good and more are bad), this event will occur later in the round so you have some time to plan for it, 2) reward and penalize the most and least industrious farmers (gave a gold or lose a gold), 3) draw and assign your workers to your own private action board.  This is the meat of the game, you have a bag that you can potentially fill (or even thin) with workers of varying types and these all have specific powers/rewards whenever you gain them and different action spaces require certain workers (colour of worker, red, white, brown, etc.).  The actions are typically get more workers of a type and gain the corresponding bonus (and you want more of EVERYTHING because it's all good!), travel on the map in order to gain valuable goods, or build trading posts on the map which are worth end game points and for which space is limited and first come first serve.  You can also assign workers to go away and perform feats/jobs for which they receive a small reward but you never get them back (you want to do this to a) thin your bag, b) gain the small bonuses, c) potentially snipe the larger citizen bonus). 4) after workers are placed, they are assigned, which essentially means you fill up your board as best you can and when it's your turn choose to activate an action (or not).  5) finally resolve the event, then pass the start player, rinse and repeat.  Points are scored for: a) money (and no this is not pittance points, it can be VERY significant), b) goods (they range from 1-5 points each), c) the sum of your built trading posts and citizens (not workers) times your multiplier on the prestige track (this is awarded primarily through acquiring and activating the gray worker).  There are also a large selection of unique special buildings, ala Caverna, that can be acquired through the black worker, and several of these can be used to score you points (they're essentially private action spaces).  The game plays quickly and smoothly as long as everyone assigns workers simultaneously (being able to adjust last minute if they're later in turn order) and once familiarity with the special buildings is attained.  It seems to play very well, albeit a bit differently from 2-4 players, and there is an option to play 5 (not sure I would want to due to downtime).  Seems to be several ways to play it/specialize and lots of potential for expansions (in the way of special buildings).  Very nice components provided you have upgraded wooden pieces.

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">The term "bag builder" (as opposed to a "deck builder") is often used to describe this game, and the term is apt.  Many of the same thought processes go into playing this game that go into deck building games like Dominion.  As in Dominion, putting together a particularly effective combination of workers in your bag can lead to a strong engine that can crush the opposition, but can also lead to repetitive play that doesn't require much thinking once the engine is humming.  Unlike base-game Dominion, there are things the opponents can do to slow you down and try to indirectly disrupt your engine.  The game is interesting and has a feeling of progression as you put together an engine, but if you are able to get things running too smoothly, you can spend much of the game doing the same thing over and over again, which is tedious.  This isn't always the case, however, and there are many paths to take toward victory in the game.  All in all, Orleans is a solid, mid-weight Euro with an interesting blend of mechanisms.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Canada">The game needs some serious house/tournament rules to work well. There's definitely a fantastic game here - it may need an expansion or some variant. The poolbuilding doesn't quite feel as impactful with the default rules.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="">While it Looks like a heavy Euro at first, it has a very easy-going flow.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">Solid Euro. Not super memorable or game changing. Bag building could be an interesting design, but someone else is going to have to figure out how to differentiate it from deckbuilding: here there was no real innovation; it was deck building in all but name.</comment>

The fiddliness of the end game due to the importance of turn order reduces some of the fun. I have deducted 1 from the rating due to that.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">3/21/16: This game is a lot of fun, and plays very smoothly.  Need to get the expansions from DLP.  With upgraded DLP components this is beautiful.   A deck builder without cards.  You throw your acquired meeples into a draw bag.  There is a separate board where you can permanently place your less valuable meeples to "thin your deck."  The variety in the game comes from the different buildings that are used each time.  Certainly not a heavy game, but lots of fun.  I think that this was one of my favorite games at Gamestorm, and playing it there convinced me to pick it up.  Want to order the following from DLP: a) Fan Kit, b) Ostkarten #2, c) Ostkarten #3 4) Scorepad  Plays well with 4 and 5, but 5 makes the board crowded.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Germany">Nice enough, but damn, can't argue with people calling this the epitome of bland Euro...</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="South Africa">I'd been wanting to play this for a while, and while it didn't grab me, it was a fun game and I'm keen to play it a couple more times, but not going to buy it.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">This is the most impressive game I played at EuroQuest 2014. It essentially is a medium-weight point-salad that has a healthy amount of tension as players race to certain VP-scoring opportunities. But it has a "deck-building" element where players draw action tokens out of a bag, which were added in previous turns; thus, the random element is strongly influenced by the decisions you made earlier (Action tokens you purchased or kept on the board). There is also an event deck but those cards tend to affect players at the end of the round. So the end result is a game that provides meaningful decisions and handles/controls randomness very well.   Component wise... not the best. The browns/blacks are too close together, the action tokens are obnoxiously thin to pick up, and the game did seem to age worst than other games (aka... ink coming off, seams on player board showing, etc). Is it bad... no. Could it be better... yes. I'd say gamers would be very please with this 5-10 years ago but with publishers pushing industry standards... it ends up looking average. </comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">I understand where others say "it's a drafting game that you don't know what you're building towards" which I think holds a large amount of truth in it in terms of how to approach the initial 1/3rd of the game (if not longer) with the accumulation of workers for your economic engine of sorts. There is probably 1/3rd of the game where you're focused on cards and getting started on the board, but determining what to do there falls out of a co-dependency with other players (as does when to have that switch in focus and balance). There is a certain amount of an engine building or a workforce management that you work on at the beginning and then there is this transition into board focused spatial play. In that regard, it sort of reminds me of a more complicated Lewis &amp; Clark with staffing and card usage each turn with the spatial piece of The Great Zimbabwe added in and a slathering of generic euro engine building layed on top. One area that it different from TGZ is there seems to be a certain amount of runaway/snowball effect that the milestones provoke and the underlying question is "who can runaway faster" as the end post you're reaching for doesn't change, so delaying getting a milestone isn't to your benefit if you're going to try and incorporate it into your strategy. Conversely, because anyone who meets a milestone's condition that turn receives it, there is a dominant pathway of recruitment that provides for an advantage..  Compared to Indonesia (the other heavy econ Splotter I have), this feels slightly more tactical, much more euro-y (build some semblance of an engine, crank it as hard as possible, try and run away with it, etc), less permanent (due to how marketing happens and things sort of turn quickly as a result of changed demands and a better ability to forecast what's coming) and less opaque in it's decision analysis. I would say it's less opaque as well in terms of just saying "well is this a good idea or no?" By no means is it a simple game, just a general comparison of the two titles (not all of that is bad, just different).   Conversely, the plethora of things you can do is almost dizzying in a wonderful way, even if there are two areas of strategic pivoting (once at the onset of the game, and again after about 8 turns when everyone is up and running for a bit). It is much more dynamic with price cutting/raising and changing demand via marketing expiration piece make for a really interesting twist on interaction, and I find it more interactive than either Indonesia or Roads &amp; Boats. Slightly stronger 7 than Roads &amp; Boats (primarily due to interaction and play duration), not nearly as interesting to me as Indonesia (which I say is a 9). It rises above "generic heavy euro" but not by much.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">Definitely a game that rewards multiple plays.  It's hard to know which engine to build when the changing geography will wreck your plans!  Very well-designed.  Great retro art, terrific player aids, and superb graphic design.  Certainly a little long for me, but played pretty smoothly.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="France">must play this game again to see if my initial feeling goes up or down</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="England">Played with the milestones despite being my first game and managed a narrow win. Very thinky, heavy and absolutely brutal if you make mistakes. Really like it. The paper money and the board stink... But it's a quality game.  Edit: the &#163;69.99 RRP for this price is wholly unacceptable when it has paper money and really mediocre board tiles. This is a shame as I love the card and "player menu" design as well as the wooden components. And the gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. But I doubt I'd pick up a copy of this at that price.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Denmark">I can see the potential in this one and will be willing to play again. I am not sure I like the fact that the board plays such a huge role in how a game will develop/is played. </comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">While there is an economic element to this game, the logistic and drafting elements are the most defining and influential ones. This is a game about creating demand and fulfilling that demand to earn money, which is essentially victory points. To do both things efficiently, players must draft and upgrade their employees, which are represented by cards. But that is only half of the puzzle... the other half lies with the abstract/logistic nature of the game board, which dictates the access/distance between players' restaurants and the houses/vendors.   Furthermore, this is a VERY interactive euro. There is no safe-place in Food Chain Magnate... players can undercut you, advertise products that you can't fulfill, and deny you access to high-tier employees. This is a game where a single mistake can have a domino effect where you end up firing your high-tier employees, which took you several turns to train. And there are no catch up mechanics in this 3+ hour game.   And like other Splotter titles, this game is very low luck. In the beginning of each round, the cards/employees that players choose are done by simultaneous action selection. And while this may seem like rock-paper-scissors... in reality, players know what others are attempting as everything is drafted/upgraded openly. Furthermore, because high-tier employees cost salaries, it's rare that someone would have so much flexibility that you couldn't make an educated guess on what they would play. And even if they did, you can manipulate turn order by having empty employee slots.  The last element, which I really like about Food Chain Magnate, are the milestones. Basically, these are bonuses that are given to players who are first to accomplish one thing or another. And these bonuses become unavailable after the round in which they are first obtained. Functionally, these milestones create a focal point, which creates tension, and encourages player to adopt different strategies.   Overall, this cut-throat interactive euro isn't going to be for everyone... but it is the type of game that I love to play. And perhaps most impressively, the game isn't that complicated compared to the meaty decisions it manages to create. This isn't a relaxing walk in the park... this is a walk in a mine field.   That being said, the game isn't without criticism. From a mechanical point of view, there is little I can find fault in. The most notable criticism would be that the game can slow down with intense competition. But from a component point of view, Splotter has made some bewildering publishing decisions... &#8226; The milestones should have never been printed on cards. It makes an already cluttered game even more cluttered. &#8226; There is a good chance that goods will run out in the game. Food tracks should have been included. Furthermore, food tracks make the game less fiddly as players are often obtaining/discarding food.  &#8226; The cards should have had iconography on the right/left borders so players can see them while splayed out. Trying to plan your turn, with 20+ some cards, is simply obnoxious without laying everything in the open (and of course, this is suppose to be done in secret).   In the end, Splotter delivers substandard component quality at a huge premium. Many people defend their component quality by highlighting how rare/niche their games are. But with so many heavy euros coming out each year,... with much better components and lower prices... I don't quite buy it. Simply put, I think Splotter is stuck in the past, which is preventing their designs from reaching their full potential.</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Germany">Really good economic game. The flow of the game could me more elegant and there is a lot to organize (shifting cards, placing wooden tokens, ...) every round. Apart from this it is a very good game, which I enjoy to play. In direct comparison I may prefer Power Grid, or Steam. Although that is just my personal preference.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Denmark">I really enjoy the card play and engine building in this game. Sadly, my wife is turned off by the bland board art and indeterminate game length. It is hard to talk her into a game at all. My only concern is the scripting of the opening moves in a 2 player game. The general consensus appears to be that there is a clear opening strategy that must be followed to be competitive at all. That disappoints me a bit and ruins the true "sandbox" nature of the game for me. This hold the game back a bit in my eyes.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Sweden">What's all the fuss about? The game is good, but not particularly interesting. Have to give it more than 6 because it felt balanced and rather elegantly designed despite the variable player powers. Would definitely play it again but will not acquire. Surprised it is so highly rated.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Wales">A dry Euro game with no thematic integration and the usual mix of network-building/engine building mechanics, this time with dice (worker) placement. It doesn't add much to the genre, but it's a perfectly good example of its ilk. You could do a lot worse, but there is nothing extraordinary here.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">Although it has some original appeal and interesting combinations, the dice are very fiddly. Paying your low roll to place on top is not smooth. Moving is very difficult and adds killer decisions - make a wrong move and you can't recover. It feels bad when you're behind late as well. Maybe this is a game that is just too tight? The unique player powers are lopsided I think - even though most are fine. I'll need to play again I think.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United Kingdom">Lots of replay value. A longer game than the box suggests, with a complicated, long rule book. The game is better explained than learned via reading.  Typically interesting dice mechanics is from the author.  Lots of fiddly bits, but these do add replayability. Perhaps it could play quicker as you get to know it better. Not sure that I prefer it to some his other games but we will see.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">I actually like this one a little more than [b]Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar[/b].  It seems like there is a little less going on--still quite a lot, mind you!--but it seems a somewhat more approachable.  Lots of icons and ramp-up, but it plays cleanly.  Interesting choices to make every turn and doesn't overstay its welcome.  I like how the high and low dice offer interesting possibilities.  And the asymmetric characters are great!</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Poland">Probably the first dice placement game that I've played. Good euro game with variable players' powers and interesting theme.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="">This is a nicely designed euro where you roll your five dice, then in player order, use them as workers on board spaces that provide you with resources, travel camels, or money, that can then be used to fulfill victory point/extra benefits contracts. or allow you to travel across a board to spaces which also earn you benefits, often immediately, and at the beginning of subsequent rounds.    Once a worker space is taken, subsequent players can use that space, but the subsequent use costs extra money, which seems to be scarce in the game.   The worker placement aspect of the game worked fairly nicely in our four player game, but I tried very hard to always be first to place each round.  I did not like paying those extra costs!  The addition of seemingly game breaking asymmetrical powers for each player, drafted at the beginning of the game, definitely adds spice or interest to the game, predictably encouraging die hard euro gamers to test out each seemingly wild power over the course of several games.    Thee powers were nice to play with, but in retrospect, they seemed a bit like adding catnip for euro gamers who are curiously and doggedly determined to prove that certain powers clearly break the game.  I do wonder:  could the rest of the game stand on its own, be of interest over repeated plays, without these asymmetrical powers?  Not sure.  Lastly, I won my first game by going very heavy on fulfilling contracts to the detriment of moving on the board.  I seemed to be the only player doing this.  Some in the comments here have suggested that this "fulfill contracts" approach is too powerful.  After only one play, all I can say is maybe.  Fulfilling contracts seemed to me to be the central purpose of the game (similar to MANY euros), so I am not quite certain as to why winning the game by fulfilling the purpose of the game is a problem.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Denmark">An interesting euro which blend a lot of different mechanisms together. The rules are pretty straightforward, but this is not a gateway game - you will not know what to do before your first game. </comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Luxembourg">I am hesitant to write about this game now that I have some bad memories, but the truth is that all the wonderful narrative that has pales with the complete luck dependent of the gameplay. I am really struggling to think of any meaningful decision I make in any of the games.  Also the mechanic of constantly killing characters does not grow well on me.  Again, theme wise it is almost perfect.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">Having played and *wanted* to enjoy Arkham Horror, but unable to get past the overwhelming components and play time, I was anxious to give this supposed slimmed down version a try. I think it delivers very solidly. The system is quite trim now - where everything (I mean nearly *everything*) is placed on the tons of card decks. So it's a sprawling mess in that way - but it's better than ten zillion tokens of it's fat brother. To be sure, there's still dozens of tokens - but it all seems more manageable. The theme sure comes through with the load of text on every item in the game - characters and encounters. Love the gooey theme for sure - FFG is better behaved, but still seems to like tossing in game-ending cards as well. But if I'm longing for what amounts to an experience game of weird horror and have about 45-60 min per player to spend, this one does it better than most.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="">A frustrating and mind numbing co-op experience.

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">Love the narrative rich adventure. I really want to love the mechanics too. They ARE better than Arkham Horror. But the game still trips up with an annoying amount of random skill check dice rolls to determine almost everything. And when you don't succeed, the game loves to punish you by making you accomplish even less in the future.  There's also the fact that the base game has way too few cards. The expansions help. But the content is frustratingly slim without buying those.  That doesn't mean I don't like the game. It's fun when I want to play something like this. And definitely if somebody has expansions! But it's also frustrating that it isn't better.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="">A good game that is well thought out with a great Lovecraftian theme. You and your team mates play as investigators/saviours that have to travel the world solving mysteries to halt the coming of the Ancient One, a godlike archdemon that will destroy the earth!  The game play works very well, player having 2 actions per turn (Move, rest, aquire assests, get train tickets etc...), then each player resolves an encounter at their location. The encounter you must perform is dependant upon what is at your location, if there is a monster you must fight it, if there is a token, you can choose to resolve it (Some are clues, some are rumours), or you can choose to resolve a random encounter card. After actions and encounters are completed the mythos phase happens, where actions regarding demons, portals and doom counters are resolved.  I really enjoyed the game, the rules were quite easy to pick up, it was immersive and flowed very well, the only true gripe I have is the total lack of variety in encounter cards; I lost count of how many times we were each an actor in a play (You'll know the card I mean when you play the game). It seems strange to me that they've obviously taken the time to make a game that looks and plays so well then to really short change the players on encounters, especially when there is a whole phase of the turn dedicated to them. Maybe the expansions address this issue, but it's still quite cheeky to force people to buy expansions in order to have a game that feels completed.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Canada">A non-rondel game from the rondel master. This time he cleverly and seamlessly slipped the rondel feel into a hand of action cards with Ancient Rome exploration and building as the backdrop.   Gameplay involves selecting an action card and executing it each turn, with one if the actions being to get your hand of cards back again. Everyone starts with the same hand but during the course of the game your deck will grow and change. The rules and gameplay are relatively simple but the strategy and decisions are not. The goal is to get the most points and these are obtained through multipliers on the cards and payout similar to Navegador.   The actions are as follows: 1) move (optional) and build in a city/region (this is a coveted action as presence in regions/built cities key off of many of the point multipliers), 2) purchase new cards (the more cards the more options and the more points), 3) generate resources from a region or take money, 4) copy an action played by another player, 5) buy and/or sell resources which is very important for cash generation and resource flexibility, and 6) retrieve your cards, while generating a small amount of cash and having an opportunity for generating more colonists. There are more of the same, different, and similar cards that you can acquire through option 2.  The game goes into end phase when either the last card has been purchased or when a player has built his last house (these are built in cities). Points are scored at the end, are scored for several different categories, and can be huge IF you focus on meshing your card collection with your actions taken (example creating a lot if new colonists and purchasing cards with colonist cards- the temptation is simply to card grab).  The game board is double-sided for different number of players and the game seems to scale well for 3-5 players (I have not tried 2er yet). The components are excellent as always for a Gerdts game. This is a very solid, professional design.  Own the [boardgame=165023]Britannia &amp; Germania[/boardgame] and [boardgame=181084]Salsa[/boardgame] expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">Clever game though too dry.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">7 plays / 3,4,5 players (2h-2.5h)  LIKE: Good decision tree, some engine building. Smaller maps are better as they create more tension for building (Italy was good w/3 &amp; 4). Variable setup. Easy to learn because your actions are on the cards. DISLIKE: Dry. Difficult to get to the table, until people are familiar with the game.  OVERALL: You really have to balance your resource engine, but it seems there aren't any bad moves, only moves that are more efficient, so a very forgiving game. Tighter maps lead to better interaction. Point deduction on the rating because the game has a dry theme, but otherwise a fun game.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">Very elegant Euro game with an interesting hand management element.  Reminds me of Lewis and Clark, though I like Concordia better.  With five players, there can be times when you have your next several moves planned and it makes the down time between turns seem overly long, but this doesn't happen too often.

The resource system was a little inflexible, but it didn't drag down the game.  No shortage of interesting choices to make.  Hard to tell who was winning without really adding up everyone's scores.  It also had some "constricted network" parallels with [b]Power Grid[/b].</comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">2-5(4)  Preliminary: It plays smoothly and has a very interesting deck-building (while not really, as buying cards isn't really "bloating" your deck). The balance between focusing on your tracks and trying to broaden a bit (and get those useful action cards) is pretty interesting, if it feels a bit dry.  It did feel a bit too open with just two, though, and with the cards on selection being a bit constrained without much competition otherwise on the map.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">Played 3 handed and I confess I failed to grasp the required strategies until too late in the game but appears to be several routes to victory and I need to play more to really evaluate it. Subsequently played again and there's more depth than it appears - good game - dreadful box art</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">I enjoyed this quite a bit. It's helpful to have a look through the cards before the game - my first game was a bit soured because I was waiting for the Vespe (sp?) cards to come out so I could make a ton of points from having dollars, but apparently there aren't any of those cards.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Poland">I think the beginning part of the game would be always similar. Though it's nice game.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">Everything appears to be present and correct in terms of balance, playability, multiple strategies etc, etc, &amp; it's a very solid, enjoyable, if not outstanding euro. One thing - something about it felt familiar in concept to Taj Mahal (admittedly this is probably just me - the card play was different but the routes, scoring etc struck me this way). Anyway, the upshot was it made me want to play Taj Mahal.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Belgium">Good game, but it takes quite some time to play with 4 players. Think it would be better to play with max 3 people.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="">This is a solid, intelligently designed euro that offers many respectable paths to victory.  The card play and deck building, with dual use aspects to the cards (card effect and end game VP multiplier) feels interesting to think about, and is perhaps the most "originalish" aspect to the game. (As an aside, I prefer the dual use aspect of the cards in Snowdonia - effect and VP win conditions.)   Unfortunately, for my tastes, the rest of the game, the overall feel of the game, feels tired, like an essentially themeless placement of wooden houses around a map of europe, which after the hundredth time of doing this sort of thing in a euro game, I find boring.  And, of course, there is resource planning, and resource conversion, in order to place these houses on a map of europe or buy cards that help me. Yawn, boring! Gameplay is also a bit too solitary for my tastes.  Are we actually interacting here?  Barely.   I greatly respect the intelligence and integration of the design mechanics in the game; they probably deserve an 8.  This is a masterful standard euro mechanic design.  But the tired, (let's be honest) themeless, solitaire gameplay in Concordia knocks this game down to a 7.  I barely want to play Concordia again, so that means I should probably give it a 6.  But, I am holding out hope that the second play will brighten my perspective on this game, so gonna give it a 7.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Australia">one of my favorite games that uses deckbuilding rather than being a deckbuilder, and due to the fact that your actions often help other players it always feels like a fairly friendly style euro</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Denmark">A well designed and balanced economic game. The most interesting part is buying cards that work as both actions and a way to score victory points.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Canada">A really good mix of war game and euro mechanisms with a very intriguing theme make for a great game. This game is one of the few games that makes area control enjoyable to me. The excellent rule set allows for a decently quick understanding of all of the actions (considering the game depth), and the player sheets give a perfect length description of the actions so you rarely have to flip through the rules to check something. The only thing that brings the rating of this game down a bit is the 3 hour length, as it stops me from getting it to the table as often as I would like.   </comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">Only played 2 player so far.  Delicious chaos.  At 2 player, you had better be okay with very direct conflict. Domination cards can really be mean.  Focus on strategy, not revenge.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Sweden">Massive worker placement. Good interaction. Area-control.  Mechanics make sense.  Too long though, it's a really good game which feels like it maybe takes twice as long as you'd want.  Also they blend the use of animal class and animal which makes it harder for new peoples to comprehend plus maybe they should had called the domination cone an best adapted / adaption / survival cone or something such to make domination more intuitive and understandable for people.</comment>

Not over complicated and a nice tableau building aspect. Not a super deep game but pleasant.  2nd Play: Played with wife, my scores were much better than last time, and she did decently well.  The game limits choices nicely but allows for some strategic planning when it's not your turn.  The board is nice to look at and the game plays in a short timeframe.  Pimping with real buttons is easy and improves the currency as well.</comment>

Patchwork is a game about balancing needs for puzzle pieces to make a quilt with income and time.  Information is completely open.  If that sounds brain-burny, it really isn't because choices are limited each turn. The net result is a charming and clever game.  The artwork - with each of those puzzle-pieces redolent of scraps of fabric and buttons the currency - significantly adds to the charm.  Production quality is good.   </comment>

Roll has become a fantastic alternative that lets me quickly learn and experience (an admittedly less intricate) race for the Galaxy at a mechanically more approachable level.

It is a fun worker-placement/role-selection game with handfuls of dice, a fairly good level of theme, and as much strategy as luck. Not deep but fun enough to play whenever it comes out. A good "crossover" game that both kids and adults will enjoy. I find that I prefer it to Race for the Galaxy.</comment>

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">This is actually one of the better dice games that I've played. But it's still a dice game. People can potentially be shut out due to the dice not giving them any options (NOTE: I was playing with the wrong rule for the longest time, You may assign ANY die to ANY action to activate that action regardless of the die's result.).  There is a fair amount of multiplayer solitaire in Roll. But honestly, the game has actually grown on me over time. I enjoy playing it now more than I enjoyed it several plays ago. So that's a pretty good design.</comment>

Totally not spectacular either, without many opportunities for huge game-changing moves. It's a meatier filler game that plays quick and scratches the engine-building itch.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="Netherlands">Not as good as Race ft Galaxy - 2players, but very similar to Race for more than 2 players.  Too random, but still a nice game.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="Australia">Probably *needs expanding*.  A game I am only just beginning to grok and properly enjoy. Suffers from an odd play time: 15 minutes too long to be a filler and 15 minutes too short to feel satisfying on its own. For a game so simply about optimal engine building it also feels bizarrely mechanically dilute to me; the dice are easily made inconsequential, some tiles are OP compared to others, and the guessing your opponent's move introduces risk rather than meaningful interaction, in my opinion. I like to feel the engine in a game throb: the heft of each die in Castles of Burgundy does this for me, whereas Roll is a much looser game with little direct system feedback.  10x10in2017  CT:mech  DP40</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United Kingdom">Much more satisfying than the card version.</comment>

    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="England">I'm not a big fan of area majority games but this is the best of them. Far too tactical and not enough strategy for me to rate it any higher but I still enjoy it</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">The "Granddaddy of Euro cube pushers." I adore area control/influence games, and I find that the subtle strategy in the game is a nice touch. Not hard to learn (I teach it in about 5 minutes), but the strategy takes a couple games to completely unfold. Another plus to me; you play against other players. I understand the criticism that the cards make it random to some degree, but there are ways to mitigate that through use of expansions.  Lots of folks (read; most in my experience) play this at 4 and 5p. I get that, the turn order allocation and board are interesting with lots of people. You can manipulate folks into doing your dirty work, etc. 2p though shouldn't be sneezed at (not my fav player count, but very playable). The differences are that 2p requires much more fanatical attention to the board than turn order. Where as in 4 or 5p, you can't be everywhere, let alone defend everywhere, at 2p, you basically have a shot at just about anywhere and I've found I can win various districts with just 1 dude. K&amp;I cards help 2p.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">A very abstract euro style area control game that has simple but enjoyable rules. I enjoy playing this and find everything from turn order to point system to be well designed. </comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">A pure area control game.  My memory is not good enough to keep track of the castillo, which can be important.  I liked the bluffing aspects when you have to choose a region to invade using the hidden dials.</comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">This is a card game that took a lot of learning, but once I did, I couldn't get it out of my head. I've often ended matches thinking through the development or settlements I should have made to put myself in a winning position. The gameplay is great, made even more fun and engaging with the expansions. My only real gripe is that, while there are some thematic elements to the game, depending on your opponent and/or strategy, the theme can get tossed for opportunities. I'd really like a thematic game that expanded on the mechanics and point generation of this game, but left out the "race" part. I'd like to have a game that I could actually get deeper into.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">Rating all RFTG's the same at 9.  Love this game and will play it whenever it comes to the table.

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Australia">Dropped from 9-&gt;8 due to recent expansions lose some of the cohesion of the cards, also I became more and more frustrated in explaining this game to new (or even returning players) - symbols galore! A very good game (base + 2 expansions at least) but just too much tedium in explaining it - hence playing.  Update from 8-7, a bit disenchanted of the game even with the base + first expansion, still is a bit chaotic for my taste. Could also be I have just played it too many times and a bit burned.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Germany">Played it only once and instantly won ;). That's an extra point for that. I like the theme and the gameplay seems better than San Juan for my taste, but with less interaction because every player kann choose his role so that nobody can disturb your plans.</comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="New Zealand">Interesting game, a huge number of options makes it very confusing to begin with.  The first game took 1.5 hours!  Alex says it goes down to 20 minutes, but I think that would hugely depend on the players.  Sometimes you had buckets of cards to sort and discard.  I didn't seem to be able to get any cards that would give me points (I didn't really know how to get points until half way through, which probably explains it!) and I'm not sure of a strategy at all.  I'd play again, but it's more "Whenever" than "When, when when?!?"</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">Rating of 7 includes the various expansions that I've played as well.   By far, my favorite card game.  The number of card combinations makes each play slightly different from the last.  The winner tends to be the one that can adapt best to what's currently available.  A nice blend of solitaire and interactivity.  ---  After countless games, this one has dropped a little.  It's now in the realm of "fun to play" but never do I look forward to playing.  Still enjoyable though.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">Surprisingly nice addition to the basic game. Without doubt the new cards are more complicated, but also interesting in that. It's really an expansion in my estimation although you can play it alone as it carries with it a bit of extra weight in complexity.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="Australia">Certainly adds a bit to the basic game.  On the other hand, that's what you expect from an expansion, and to be honest it doesn't make me want to play Dominion any more or less than before.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">I really like the point + effect cards. Some of the "player interaction" cards are very frustrating, and seem very random, which makes me prefer regular Dominion over it.  Saboteur especially is frustrating.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">Best at lower player counts as turn order bidding becomes a dance in it's own right with the two turns per round. Beautiful game with lots of decisions about possible ways to score points, and a random start. Tough to tell who is winning until the bitter end which is a particularly nice touch, and there isn't a strategy that just breaks the game (it's much more important to tailor something based on what the board tells you, and what you opponent does). I think in terms of non-interactive euros, I appreciate this one, even if it does fall out as a puzzle plus a jockeying game for turn order.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United Kingdom">Solid game with great art design, hasn't yet screamed "buy me!!" though. Not sure about replayability, more due to it losing its shine than becoming predictable.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">This game has a lot of tactics and options for players. I really like it. Solid all the way through. My only gripe is that I wished it supported more players.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">4 plays / 2,3 players  LIKE: Great production, tangible game bits. Many good choices, almost too many, but some minor strategies can be found. I enjoyed the base point scoring, modular boards, and djinn powers. DISLIKE: Board changes between every turn which induces analysis paralysis. If a player doesn't think about setting other players up, and only focuses on their own point goals, the game can go by quicker. Oh, and there is no need for the slave cards, as the theme is thin. Use the fakirs.  OVERALL: Although my wife didn't care for it, too many rules for her, I was able to teach it quickly to others. Some people find the game too much of a puzzle, but I think that is part of the fun. Not a game for over-analyzers, but a timer can help.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Finland">Five Tribes has very interesting mechanics for action selection. I found it rather refreshing. The downside is that every turn players have hundreds if not thousands of possible moves. You can imagine how a game will turn out if you played with someone prone to indecisiveness or with a will to analyse the situation completely before making any decisions. Good quality components and pleasant graphics.  The gameplay is more of seizing the opportunities rather than of building your position. However, there is some room for long term strategies and cunning which will definitely delight more experienced boardgamers.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="">I love this game's mechanic of picking up and distributing meeples to gain control over tiles. It is one of the most unique games I have ever played, I just wish the Djinns were more relevant. </comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">Maybe the best [b]Mancala[/b] derivative yet.  I love solving the spatial puzzles on every turn!  There are so many fun decisions to be had.  The early game is very AP-prone, while the late game kinda peters out...but it's fun ride.  Don't know if I'll buy or not, but it's gonna be on my mind for a while.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">A good, solid euro.  The mechanics are pretty straightforward but the strategy is deep enough to keep me engaged.  I like the variety of choices and how everything pushes and pulls on the rest.  Nicely done.  Of course this is all balanced against the inherent paralysis of all those choices and how advance planning is almost entirely fruitless (one player's move can totally destroy and/or change your options).  I can't fault others for delays when it's their turn because I end up the same way - reanalyzing and reassessing.  The dynamic nature of the game is its downfall.  I will play this from time to time, but a 4p game has the potential for serious delay.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Romania">[b]18.09.2014 - after 1 play[/b] Five Tribes is a "heavier" game from Days of Wonder, compared to the usual "TTR"-ian difficulty of their previous games.   Graphics-wise, it doesn't look too spectacular. I might say that the background of the tiles is too samey and too brownish (yes, I know the setting is a desert one). On the other hand, the Djinns have unique and gorgeous designs. The components (other than the squares that form the modular board) are solid and nice to the touch.   Theme is completely pasted-on. This game could have been about dinosaurs or SF explorers, still would have played the same.   Five Tribes has the not-so-used "mancala" mechanism (I don't know any other modern game, except Trajan, that uses it) and this is the core element of the gameplay. The other aspect of the game, the set collection one, can deliver many points at the end of the game, especially by card sets. Also the biding for turn order feels ok. In our game, the Djinn cards were almost never used so I don't know if they are useful.  Plus: the "still" fresh mancala system and the components. Minus: the AP that the mancala and the biding bring to the game. Because of the ever changing board status, you cannot plan for a move, unless you are determined to bid for first player (at least in the last half of the game). Also, some of the players may leave opportunities for the ones following them, but this is partially handled through the biding every turn.  Although there are more minuses than pluses, I enjoyed the game and would love to play it more, so that I can form a FINAL opinion.</comment>

The miniatures is what makes this incredible. But the game play is smartly easy. It is typical to rush a game - its so easy to move and attack, you find yourself often not planning much and crashing into each other. And that's not even a bad strategy if you have enough low-cost ships. Anyhow, I've sunk alot into the miniatures which admittedly might be fairly priced for the quality, but still can be very expensive. But whatever. Love it.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="Finland">Fun for non-serious gaming.

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United Kingdom">I liked it a lot but my girlfriend didn't (I won with a very large margin...). I can see why many people say it is a good gateway game. Yet to try with the expansion.</comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Brazil">great with expansions</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Scotland">This game has much more plays than recorded and done extremely well with my group.  As introduction to worker placement it is worthy of it's praise.  If you want a light game in that genre I can thoroughly recommend .  The expansion for it is excellent adding all the right things to enrich the game.  Happy to play this when I'm looking for a light game you scoialise through </comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Lightly played. Bought from LGS with box lid split in one corner. All components included with original insert.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Wales">This is a solid worker-placement game with nice aesthetics, and a not-overpowering theme - minimal flavour text etc. The engine-building aspects are not complex, and the game is primarily set-collecting, but it all works nicely, and in a good shortish time-frame. The curse of many Euros, the cubes never get called by their real titles and hence the theme is never fully realised.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">Check out my written review here! http://bgpov.com/games/fantasy/lords-of-waterdeep/</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Not extremely deep, but would probably make a good gateway to euro games. The only negative is the insert. I didn't find it nearly as useful as others so I tossed it and keep everything in a Plano box. Much quicker setup.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">7+ plays / 4,5,6 players  Mostly played with the expansion.  LIKE: A relatively fast worker placement. Secret goals offer variety. Multiple paths to victory. Quest cards are fun. Buying buildings adds a bit of engine-building fun. DISLIKE: Can feel a bit repetitive, some intrigue cards are overpowered/swingy. The 40-point quest cards ensure victory. Can be cruel and cutthroat at times.  OVERALL: Fun game, but a bit swingy.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">As everyone has said, this game is quite good. It isn't remarkable, however, but it is very well constructed and produced. The fantasy theme is completely pasted on as only titles and pictures tell you anything - mechanically, it is bone dry Euro - and yet still sits well. As with all ramp up the selection games (Agricola, Caylus, Endeavor, etc), the game tends to slow and creak as analysis settles in and options fan out. Our game had a king-maker situation at the end in which I had two options for my last play - either one of which determined the victor. There is also some aspects of upstream player order sniping off the parts you need - especially so if you are playing along similar strategy lines. And I could imagine some random roll out of buildings, Lords cards and Quests making the game miserable for some. But other than that, there isn't much to dislike. A solid work and I'd play it again, but I doubt it has much staying power.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Fun worker placement based on the D&amp;D Franchise. Plays better with 2 than with 4. The theme is really weak in this one; The makers were fooling no one with the "Cleric/Fighter/Wizard/Rogue" Cubes that are needed to complete tasks.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United Kingdom">Updated from 8.5 to 7 once I realised the luck involved. Still a good game though</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">2-6 players</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">Stellar worker placement with a fantastic Dungeons and Dragons theme. Very little to be desired besides a bigger board. </comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Worker placement with a really well integrated theme. Unlike many typical "soulless euros", in Lords of Waterdeep You aren't just placing meeples on spaces and trying to optimize a cube economy with a pretty vague reason as to the why. No, in lords you are placing members of your lords house/faction (meeples) in different districts of the city of water deep in order to build certain buildings or take actions that involve sending different groups of clerics, Warriors, Wizards, and Rogues on quests. The more quests you complete, the more points you will earn for end game scoring. This game is a really well put together experience. According to the lore, wotc staff had to make the game on their lunch breaks and then pitch it to the executives after the fact because they initially thought it was a terrible idea. This was a labor of love and it shows in the design. Bravo.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">Good introductory worker replacement.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Not the most intersting of worker placement games, but one that is simple enough for even my wife to enjoy.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">My simple worker placement game go to. Send out agents, recruit adventurers, complete quests with the adventures and sometimes gold, receive bonuses and victory points. Alot of people complain that this game lacks theme, but I find that the theme is there, you just have to have the mindset that you are actually a shadowy lord doing all these things! Easy to teach, good solid game</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Surprisingly fun game for how simple it is.  Only play on ios.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">well made but i sometimes feel that the choices are not very important outside the quests you get.    I sometimes feel commerce quests are over powered (sort of snow ball since you typically get things as a reward which build into your future quests).</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">A very good game!  Yes, it's pretty much just [b]Caylus[/b] but it's streamlined and a helluva lot easier to teach.  Good production values, too.  I see myself buying this one soon.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">+ Take the DnD theme and pour it into a euro mold; Extremely high quality board and pieces in this game. - The quests were way too swingy; The hidden roles/objectives are boring at best.   Why it's previously-owned: I was expecting way too much with this one.  It ended up just being a cube pusher (and a fairly generic one at that) where you were way too dependent on what quests came up for you on your turn. I traded this away with Roll Through the Ages for Tournay (before it was available in the states).  There are a gazillion worker-placement games that we play instead of this one.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">Huh. This was quite fun... but it would probably be just as fun if it went all the way and was just an app. I like the way the game can randomise what's happening, which was fun and unique. It's also nice to not have a dumb-AI running the monsters.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">The jury is still out.  I can see this being great, or getting old quickly.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Denmark">I am not much into horror games, but the way the app works is brilliant! I am looking forward to similar apps for Descent and Imperial Assault.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Austria">quite some potential</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Italy">The second edition of Mansions of Madness introduces quite a few innovations, but the main difference is obviously the app-driven game: this has both positives (almost no set up time, completely cancels the chance of ruining a multiple-hour game due to mis-set up, greater feeling of exploration with the map generated during gameplay) and negatives (much more predictability in enemies' behavior, more generic events for the sake of adaptation to different situations).  The play experience is undoubtedly smooth and enjoyable, and quite atmospheric, even if the length of the scenarios tends to be on the longer side, and probably some are not so replayable.  In a short sentence: better than first edition, good game, even if it is not the definitive game in its genre.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Canada">Initial Impression: This time FFG added an app to their list of high quality, thematic components. Counter-intuitively, the app actually adds to the thematic immersion of the game, with its dark visuals and soundtrack playing in the background. The gameplay is fairly straightforward, as each player is allowed 2 actions on their turn, which includes movement, exploration, and interaction with people and objects. The cooperative aspect of the game is highlighted as the players strive to survive the threats and obstacles of the Chapter, while accomplishing the mission objectives. Unfortunately, there's no mechanism included which prevent alpha-gaming. The one thing that puzzles me with this game is that it could very well have been a full fledged tablet game rather than a boardgame, as the app takes care of almost everything. Still, the game system has lots of potential and is ripe for expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">I've never played the first version but this game oozes theme and the app really allows the group to focus on the game itself rather than micromanaging rules. It's still very fiddly even with the app and is a long game which are detractors for me but I'll gladly play this game in the right circumstances. The components are top notch too.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Vietnam">It managed to create an intense thematic feeling during my first game (I was afraid to be alone many times). The app definitely helps.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">Fun, but I'm still not sure about the long term mileage - I've played through the first mission a few times and it starts to feel very "samey".</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="">*Disclaimer: The listed rating/10 is heavily weighted towards my enjoyment of the game and the experience that it provides. Each pro and con are factored individually towards a cumulative score, but do not have fixed increments in which they can detract or increase a rating.  Pros: + Incredibly Thematic + Intuitive Mechanics + App Streamlines the Game + Captivating Storytelling  Cons: - Too Long - Over Reliant on App - Mythos Phase is Slightly Tedious - Poor Miniatures - Overpriced </comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">I'm not a big fan of "ameritrash" nor I am a fan of the Cthulhu theme yet I quite enjoyed the game. We tried the introduction scenario and were able to beat it fairly easily. The app was really well done and obviously avoids having to dedicate a player to control the bad guys. Definitely interested to try some of the longer, more difficult scenarios.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">This game. Not sure what's up with it because I simultaneously want to criticize it and extol its virtues from a mountain top. First of all, I feel like 70% of my play is interacting with the app. This is heightened in solo play because I can't pass the app off to another player. This means my memories of the game revolve around the iPad and that bothers me just a bit.  However, the game makes great use of the app to streamline play and pull surprises. The benefit of an electronic element such as this is that the game can pull the rug out from under you and surprise you in ways a player restricted by structure can't. I LOVE that and want to be hit with more of those moments.  Much of this game is going to come down to scenario design and I'm excited for the future. Right now, the game has enormous potential but it doesn't fully live up to it. It's enjoyable and a solid game, but I'm not sure it's worth the price tag for what you get in the base game.  --------------------------------------------------------------- Full review: http://geekandsundry.com/mansions-of-madness-2e-is-the-future-of-board-gaming/</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United Kingdom">Just bought this game.  Only played once and didn't finish as ran out of time, but cannot wait to play again.  Huge fan of the TV series and always concerned that tie-ins (video or board game) are typically a massive disappointment.  However, this was an amazing surprise!</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">0.5 points subtracted due to never drawing Cylon card. Playing human makes game not as fun as it could be.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">First off, BIG fan of the show. I was really looking forward to playing this game after a friend bought it. So we've played 2 games of it and though I do enjoy it, there are problems. First problem is with the pilot characters. Once you play a pilot (even a hottie like Boomer), you probably won't want to play that role again. There can be long periods of boredom playing that role and that's not fun gaming. The other problem is play time. This puppy is a long one and I mean 4-6 hours long. Okay, I'm a bit A.D.D. but this game will try anyone's attention span. Now beyond those two issues, there's lots of fun to be had. Trying to ferret out the Cylon player is good detective fun. If you're the Cylon, you get to brush up on your acting skills. As many players have commented, there's plenty of paranoia starting about mid-game. It's juicy fun not knowing what the next crisis might be or if the President is a toaster or not when ugly crisis come back to back. This is the kind of game that can really be enjoyed by the right group (at least 4 players).   **Update** Too long. Plenty of thematic play but it just takes forever. I could have easily played 2 other games (to completion) by the time this was over.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">I really enjoyed this game.  I was Gaius Baltar, the President, and the Cylon.  I am not sure it would be as much fun if I wasn't the Cylon, let alone President Gaius Baltar the Cylon President. I sure did have a blast deceiving and destroying the pathetic humans though.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">Co-op-ish game with interesting ways for the Cylons to be sneaky and mess up the humans. Runs a little long, but it's intense and keeps you involved the whole time.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">Great game.  Really Enjoyed my first play.  Ended up in the brig as a human, but it was still a lot of fun.  Can't wait to try this again. Still really like this game.  Only thing is that I end up being the Cylon too many times.  It's a running joke at my game group... </comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Finland">I have only played it couple of times but I really liked the theme and the feeling of betrayal. Though at some point it felt a bit long, it might get better when everybody is familiar with the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">Really captures the theme of the series, but the more I play this the more it wears on me.  It's the funnest game ever until the cylons are revealed and then the game drags on slowly towards inevitable death.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">Good hidden traitor game if you can get past all of the other shit that the game tacks on.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="">Lots to enjoy in this game if everyone gets into the spirit of it. That said, quite a lot of upkeep during the game and can sometimes run on for too long.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">(B&amp;L Own) Fun hidden traitor game, with a theme that exceptionaly well tied into the series. Heavily weighted against the humans.  I really think the theme shines brightly with this one. They did an exceptional job tying it together with the mechanics. I think the game plays best before the cylon is outed. After that it just devolves into the cylons beating the crap out of the humans until they crumble. Our games have been very heavily weighted towards cylon victories.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United Kingdom">Probably the best co-op game available. Not particularly keen on being a Cylon and dislike the Cylon Leader roles but generally good fun. Can be quite quick when everyone knows what they're doing.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="">Wonderful hidden traitor / Asymmetrical Co-Op game. Very easy for beginners to get into and does not feel like it takes three hours to play although most of the time it does.   My least favorite part of the game however is the nomenclature of the plastic pieces and the combat tables. As someone who has seen the show I know what a Viper is but the rule book is not so forgiving to players who may like this style game but have not indulged in 4 seasons of the show.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">As a BG fan I had to play it! Awesome game!</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">Picked this up to try with our D&amp;D group, and the response has been very positive!  Everyone involved so far has enjoyed playing, and I have to admit that it gives a very unique experience.  Lots of fun when we can get enough people!  Update: Going to have to bump this up to a 9 due to how much fun everyone has when we get it to the table.  Update: Looks like the honeymoon is over!  Can't get this one to the table any more.  Long setup time, tricky to explain the rules to new players, and large player requirement.  Dead of Winter has pretty much replaced it.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">One of our gateway games. I still enjoy playing this one, but it is harder and harder to find willing players so it mostly just sits on our shelf. It can be a very quick game, so I still enjoy playing it. If it was any longer I would rate it lower.  Update 7-24-16: I was unkind in my opinion of this game in lowering the rating to a 6. Even though we gave this game away to my SIL as a game library building present, I've had a chance to play this many times since at various friends' houses, and have never turned down the chance. It's a great gateway game. We don't need to own it ourselves anymore, but it doesn't make it a bad game. Bumping it back up to a 7.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United Kingdom">I had a whole mess of initial thoughts on this - tending towards the negative - but I've grown to accept it. Good game, still stands strong today.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Germany">I think it gives too much hipe about this game(at least in Germany). It is very good but not as fantastic as you read. I think the expansion Seaside makes it better. All the others are always the same stuff.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">I like Dominion despite not being that good at it.  I have played many more times than are recorded, with all of the sets and promos.  I don't care for the attack card "arms escalations" that can happen, I'd rather just build draw/money engines and buy the cards I want.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Canada">A card game that scales well from 2-4 players, has good variability, and a unique deck-building mechanic which puts a different spin on the current engine building game craze.  Gameplay is simple: always draw 5 cards, then A) play an action card(s), if possible.  These generally do things like get you more cards, allow for more buying opportunies, give extra money to build, etc., B) buy a card(s).  Cards come in 3 general forms: 1) point cards, which do nothing, but are what you need to score points (to win the game), 2) action cards, which give special abilities, and 3) money cards, which allow for purchases in the buy phase. C) clean up your deck, which is to say put all drawn cards into your discard pile.  As the game goes on, you will want to switch from money and powers to points.  The more points, the less flexibility you have.  Game ends when either 3 piles of different cards are emptied, or the 6 point card pile is empty.  There are several different types of action cards that you can substitute into play, which supposedly significantly affects gameplay.  I've only tried to mix things up once, and didn't notice much difference in the general strategy, but with more plays that may change.  This is a good game, a very solid filler, with some light strategy.  A top 10 game though?  Hardly.

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Fun, and incredibly addictive! I love this game and everybody I introduce to it asks me where they can purchase it. The game starts out very basic, with only a small selection of options available, but every turn, the amount of things you can do grows even to the point where you have to laugh. I like the fact that this game is about putting combos together on the fly. See what options are available each turn to buy, see what kind of actions you can take, and watch your plan unfold turn by turn. The game is very simple to teach to others, but the strategies that are available give it tons of depth and infinite re-playability. Over all this game is great, one of my absolute favorite games! If I was going to lock myself in a nuclear fallout shelter for 50 years, and could only bring 50 games with me Dominion would be one of them.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">An old favorite. Dominion is a must have in my opinion. One of the only "Geek" games my wife will play.  EDIT: My wife is now an official "gamer"! Her username is ShanHitson. She loves a few games and likes a lot of them. She recently wrote a review on one of our favorites, Dominant Species.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Played a prototype or something at a convention thing, and I played a poker chip version; I have yet to play the actual published version. :p It's a nice little card game that is light and fun. You start with a small amount of cards and build your deck throughout the game by buying more cards with your current cards. I like deck building and I like that there is a lot of variety and different things you can try out.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Trade interest low.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">My girlfriend loves this game and almost always beats me, so for that reason alone it's one of the most valuable games on my shelf!  It isn't my favorite, and I find myself getting bored sometimes knowing it's just going to be a race for Provinces, but the kingdom card variation and the expansions do mix it up and keep it fun.  I shouldn't knock it too much...while it might not be the most interesting game, it's usually fun, and a good intro game for non-gamers.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Australia">Great gateway and still my favorite deck building game.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Luxembourg">I have not played Dominion for a long time. It is true that every time I play it I remember how much I like it, but a lot of new games are coming out that expand what it did.  Also I only own the base game so I don't have as much variability as others might have.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Great gateway game but with all the deckbuilding games that followed it I'd rather player Quarriors or Nightfall.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Germany">Great game idea and flow of play, but I don't like the mechnics of the individual cards, because they are to abstract. This game should be redone with more direct effects like in a collectible card game.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Rating of 7 includes the various expansions that I've played as well.   By far, my favorite card game.  The number of card combinations makes each play slightly different from the last.  The winner tends to be the one that can adapt best to what's currently available.  A nice blend of solitaire and interactivity.  ---  After countless games, this one has dropped a little.  It's now in the realm of "fun to play" but never do I look forward to playing.  Still enjoyable though.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Good deck building game.  Biggest perk is it isn't a Collector Game.  Gameplay isn't determined by the amount of $$ you spend!</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">An interesting game of deck building. I'm not sure if it is my cup of tea, but I do respect the design and potential for expansion. I must play a few more times before I make up my mind. I'm sure this'll appeal to a lot of people, especially the CCG/Race for the Galaxy crowd.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="">A wonderful farming, wine making, and curating experience that has flavor out the wazoo, worker placement, resource management mechanics that are great to expand our play styles.   Stonemaier never disappoints.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">Love the theme.  Need to play it more.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">As with all Stonemaier Games, this one has beautiful components and a fun theme. I don't always love worker placement games, but the theme really makes this one feel intuitive and fun. A solid solo mode doesn't hurt either!  (worker placement; 3x)</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">For a kickstarter, this game was pretty good. The theme was interesting, the bits were excellent, and I liked the engine building aspects of the game.  Like almost every kickstarter, it ended up feeling unpolished. There were parts with needless complexity (all the different buildings that no one built until the end), randomness in the form of the cards (there was such a huge difference between how good individual cards were) and pacing issues (by the end of the game, half the boards was useless).  If I were to play it again it would have to be with an odd number of players, due to how strangely tight the game is. I had fun with my one play because the theme and bits were very good.   Update: Essential edition with the big meeple and the tweaks is better and is a decent game.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="Canada">This is the sort of light worker placement game I prefer as a gateway to introduce newcomers. The visitor cards are not balanced at all and I look forward to seeing Tuscany: EE mitigate the problem with the trading action. It's simple, yet there are enough moving parts to open up some strategies. It also isn't completely deterministic thanks to the card draws. It suffers from terribly low player interaction so replayability feels limited. I don't think the area control aspects of Tuscany are important enough to fix that either.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">Despite all the hype, Fresco is better.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="Spain">Great Worker Placement game with an amazing theme. I really liked it and enjoy the time I was playing it.  Played once.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">I like this a good bit initially. It's enjoyable because you feel like you get to do a lot and make some interesting decisions without being too heavy or punishing. I think it fits a nice niche in my collection. </comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="Romania">A bit too random for my tastes. Too many chances for the cards to either combo well together, or otherwise be useless.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="">Nice worker placement game, simple and still quite good, takes the TTR 'station' route of letting you use something someone else already has to avoid blocking fights which is kind of nice, but the best thing about the game is the art. Gorgeous. </comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">Glad I finally got a chance to try this game to see if it is really as good as everyone has said. I enjoyed it because it played very quick and the variability in the setup with the mamas and papas is a nice touch. The variety of cards gives this the bit of randomness I like in games and with the quick playing time of 60 minutes for 3 players I think this could hit the table again. My only gripe is the strategy of getting the worker placement right in summer and winter as I know more than once I messed that up and it cost me a few points and likely winning the game. I look forward to trying this one again soon.</comment>

I was frustrated by my own rules mistakes (many many) which began almost immediately and I never felt like I played a full game without mistakes. (In a normal game you would get these rules bloopers ironed out over time.) I was also frustrated by things that didn't seem as clear to me as I would have liked.   I would still highly recommend the game, just pay super close attention to all the rules, especially the changes. </comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">While it's streaking up the charts, let's be clear that this isn't one of the very best games of all time. It IS, however, one of the best gaming EXPERIENCES of all time. The manner in which is extends and adds tension to the base pandemic experience is incredible, but so much of what makes it great is playing it with the same group and watching your individual experience unfold, discussing strategy and character choice and upgrades, celebrating the close wins and mourning the tough losses...the legacy format has legs and it is HERE to stay, and it is glorious. Those who can't fathom tearing up cards, prepare to weep.  After a campaign: without spoilers, I feel that the storytelling got pretty lazy late in the game, and it definitely ended with a whimper not a bang. Still awesome, but the next big legacy game (seafall?) is going to take over this #1 spot potentially (the pandemic brand might be the difference maker)</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">This new edition looks superior to the earlier one, but that is the only comparison I am qualified to make. Great game where you are surging forward through history, the different ages represented as a sort of parade of cards that you're buying from. Lots of checks and balances in this game, managing corruption, preventing uprisings, deciding when to take military actions against other players, and I love the thematic abilities of the many leader cards, wonders etc that will be visiting you in the lineup. The events are also neat, how you're adding them for future turns, really ups the strategy. Not my favorite Vlaada game, but it might creep up there with future plays, because it is substantial and I've barely cracked the surface.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Germany">Yes it is long, yes it is has nice ideas. Yes, the war mechanics are fun. But damn, why does it stay the same game for all it's duration? Why is the second playthrough exactly the same?</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Colombia">Even better than the original game. It's a game where you always have interesting choices to make, and it really feels like a true civ game in board game form. The military aspect is a bit stressing, and quite unavoidable, though, so it's a game I really like, but I might pass on playing some times.</comment>

This game seems more fitting for a person that likes to build up and use a military to conquer the world (or your opponent). Even in a peaceful game (no war or aggression) if your military is not a large part of your point generating engine, you will get left behind.  It is still a great game and deserves the high rating it has. </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">Good game with very subtle strategic elements. It's certainly rougher than 1960. Several design elements seem unnecessary at first blush - e.g. adding 1 more card in play after turn 3? Different roll values in the space race? The dice mechanic for realignment feels overly complicated - old school and unkempt. Of course, the GMT components are poor. Lastly, it plays a touch long and plods along - much like the years it portrays! But setting all that aside, the historic feel is just right and it has a grandness to it which I completely love. The push and pull of superpower's machinations comes off with great aplomb - a feat in itself.  So all in all, a great game that I willingly play - when I have the three hours required.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United Kingdom">First and foremost, this is a FUN game.  There isn't as much depth as other CDGs because of the strong possibility of wild swings of fortune - but there's enough to make it interesting.  And, this is a game whose trade-offs are exactly as the designers' introduction states - playability is good, realism/room for long-term Strategy is limited.   The card draw and the die rolling can make things see-saw very quickly.  You can win in a flash or lose in one, too.  But, you know what, since it's quick and fun, that doesn't seem to matter too much!  The theme is well done and I like most of the event cards: Flower Power, Glasnost, Defectors, Casto, Iron Lady etc, though there is the occasional lapse into something more bland, but not often. The Space Race is nice and the Influence placement (borrowed from Hannibal) is fun.  I like the way nuclear war is treated, although Defcon can be a bit unforgiving.  Card management is critical, of course - and the game is clever enough so that you can't ALWAYS get that right, though there are safety nets.  Possession of scoring cards at the right/wrong time is the MOST crucial factor.  </comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Canada">The theme is bizarre and thin, the board is garish and bland (is that even possible), the description of gameplay sounds derivative, and yet...this is a great game.  An area control/building/point grab game that scales very well from 2-5 players, and combines a variety of tried and true mechanics with some new subtle twists.  There are a set number of rounds during which you, as one of 14(!) unique races, try to conquer as much territory as possible and score as many points as possible.  You have 3 currencies in the game, money, workers, and power tokens, all of which are useful and scarce at different points in the game.  Money and workers are needed for buildings which give you income advantages and set you up for potential point scoring.  Power tokens give you access to extra actions.  Points are scored in game by meeting various round conditions (these vary from game to game), by meeting the criteria of some specific races, and by building cities.  End game points are scored for longest contiguous area and for most influence on the cult tracks.  There's alot of different, variable moving pieces in this game and it really is more than the sum of it's parts (and it has alot of parts).  When this gets a proper wide distribution it will probably be a top 20 or better game on BGG.  Looking forward to more designs by this team.

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">This is a very fun game, but be prepared for the first game to last a while.  There are a lot of choices and small rules to learn and absorb, and anyone prone to AP will have difficulty determining what optimal plays are with this one.  The races all have interesting interactions, but I feel that there are some that are strictly inferior or just un-fun if you get stuck with them.  This is, however an interesting and tight euro with many different avenues to explore.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="">One of my favorites.  A solid mechanical base with loads of  variety offered by the different races</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">My absolute favorite brain-burner at this point in time. In my mind, this is Catan done right: lots of decisions, trying to build an economic engine, and still competing with area control on the main board. In my opinion, Terra Mystica really shines in 3 player though I've played 2 and 4 players as well.  I love the flexibility of the different races and I love the optimization involved in making sure you are moving just a little bit faster than everyone else.   Similar to Agricola, you always don't have quite enough time to get done what you need to do -- but sometimes you can sneak in with something awesome, especially with a great one-time boost from building the Fortress (some races are better than others at this).  Be warned, Terra Mystica is not for the faint of heart, and takes a significant time commitment. If you feel like Settlers of Catan is over just a little too quickly, and you want more time to hone your civilization, Terra Mystica may be the game for you.   Highly recommended, only price and lack of people to play it with keeps me from buying it for my own collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">Very enjoyable game, but this is a heavy ero-style game and can be difficult to teach.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">Excellent resource management game, but because every resource is accumulated differently and each race functions differently, it has a huge learning curve. The game seems to be far too crowded with 5 players, probably be better with the alternate board and/or alternate races available in the expansion.</comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">I like to think of Terra Mystica as Settlers of Catan on steroids. Here's a game that is, at its core, about developing a civilization through spreading settlements and upgrading them into different structure types. There are many moving parts to this game and some would be turned off by it, thinking that it is incredibly complex and mind-numbing, but really, it's fairly simple to understand.  Terra Mystica really shines when you've capitalized on your culture's unique powers. The game eggs you along in different directions depending on what scoring bonuses are available and what little goals might be achievable every round, but it's how you work your culture's power into the proceedings that makes the game so fun. There are little race aspects (as in, trying to beat somebody to a destination), area control aspects, and resource management aspects that add to the heavy feel of the game. Yet, the reward of putting down a new temple or linking together a large town and earning more bonuses, keeps the game from feeling dusty and boring. Although it does not get much play among my group, it is still a staple of my shelf and one that I don't plan on retiring anytime soon.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">Excellent game with many interesting dependencies and unique play mechanics. Building cities and gaining power under strained conditions leads to excruciatingly difficult decisions. The various races in the game play quite differently and are wildly (?) unbalanced. My main take back is the trouble for new players. They can be crushed when playing against experienced folks - and frustration will set in when they realize they made early mistakes. The game is unforgiving in this way. But this hardly matters because discovering optimal play is delightful (even if losing in play)! I love it. </comment>

"Usually willing to play" fits my attitude on it quite well for the moment.  It may improve with further play, but I don't want to jump the gun.  Update: I'm bumping this up to an 8 after a few more games.  There seems to be a lot of depth here, and the variance in my final scores tells me that you can't just muddle through.

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Austria">I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.  Terra Mystica is a very challenging game. It feels very tight. You have always so many things to do, but you do not have nearly enough resources to do all what you would like to. You have to set your engine fast and try to use what you have at the best of your chances. The rules are not hard to learn, but the game is very hard to master. I like these things in a game a lot.  I also like the visual impact of the game and the components are a lot cooler than what I expected from the pictures. Also the their quality is very high, expecially the cardboard which is very thick. I don't like the art instead, but it's something I can live with.  The only doubt I have about this game is the balance between the races. I read that some of them are quite stronger than others... and I don't like that. If they were more balanced, this rating would have been higher.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Spain">The game of the moment! (summer 2013). A neat mix of well known mechanisms. There is nothing really new in the game but I like the combination of economic build up and network development in the map. The unique powers provide variability.  </comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">Wow - I admit, I thought this game would be good based on it's fast rise to top 10 status, but I was surprised it lived up to the hype.  The gameplay is super smooth, there aren't any gimmicks, it was completely open, and with just enough theme for me to develop a bit of a storyline to the board evolution. I didn't feel exhausted at the end. To think there are 14 player powers, and from what I saw, they all play very differently.  This has become my new game to rush to 5 plays so that I can buy the expansion when it gets out.</comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">:what: :) :D :D :) Pretty good game. Steep learning curve. I like it a lot -- but I like other things of equal length more.   Very long and I generally prefer it as 3P/4P; 5P seems like too many cooks.   This is a game I'm happy to play, and it hits most of the notes I like (area control, low direct interaction) but something about it feels just a bit off. Perhaps it's the (nearly non-existent) fantasy theme, as I don't like fantasy themes? Or maybe it's that some races/turns feel a little scripted. Still a pretty good game, although I question it being top-10 good.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Played it once, still thinking about the play and looking forward to the next game. This rating could easily be adjusted upwards after a couple of plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Loved it. Now need to settle into a few more games to see if it truly holds up. There's quite a bit to explore yet - not to mention playing *both* sides of the conflict. If one is seeking flaws, I think there are three. First, the game is quite long - allow 3+ hours for a first play (and it may not go down much with repeated plays). Second, there are small corner cases with cards that create conflicts to be resolved mainly by common sense. Third, the order in which you draw cards has a significant effect on the potential of the outcome. Still, the game is wonderful and is the definitive dramatic implementation of Star Wars. The *only* significant drawback is the length of play.  EDIT: One take back with this one is there really *isn't* much combat - that the game is deceptive in that way. The miniatures seem to scream old 80's games of smashing ships against one another. But in fact, combat isn't as important as deception (for the Rebellion) and fear (for the Empire). It's more a cat and mouse game than a conquest game. When combat does happen (perhaps 3-4 significant times), it is at times clunky to resolve.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Canada">Massive and highly thematic game, beautifully realized. Some huge swings in card effects sometimes. </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Initial rating.  This one will probably go up with more plays.  My buddy and I figure this game takes about 3 plays to understand the cards, strategies, and interactions.  Thematically, this nails Star Wars in a way that others do not.  [thing=939]The Queen's Gambit[/thing] is pretty good, but really just a luck fest based on crappy source material.  [thing=3284]Epic Duels[/thing] sucks.  The miniature game is alright, but has no ships.  But this one has it all -- from the good Star Wars movies.  It has oodles of cool plastic.  It has theme (find the hidden rebel base and destroy it!) it has characters, cards, and chits.  It is not overly complicated to learn but is not overly simple in strategy.  This is for the Star Wars universe what [thing=115746]War of the Ring[/thing] is for the Lord of the Rings' universe.  Is it as epic and awesome as WotR?  Time will tell.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">Great game, good Star Wars "feel" to it, engaging game play that grows with you and you learning your strategies; and comparably priced for similar style and scope games. However; the rulebook(s) are poorly written and can be a little confusing and daunting at first, but the rules are sound was deciphered. </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">1st play - Star Wars in a box - completely perfect description.  The Imperial forces are all over the Galaxy, and their size works against them.  It's hard to marshal troops in any one area, and the Rebels could be anywhere.  Toe to toe the Empire destroys the Rebels but completely thematically the Rebels are hard to force to a battle.  They're just strong enough to hold off small skirmish fights, and the missions take from all three movies - Sith corrupting Rebel leaders, Luke trains with Yoda, and the Death Star slowly builds.  Very satisfying thematic romp through the whole Star Wars story.  2nd play - This time I played as the Rebels and the experience is awesome.  The feeling of being completely outgunned and outmanned the entire time, forced to resort to guerilla tactics.  It's great fun to use the Empire's size and lack of agility against itself.   Trying to draw attention away from the hidden rebel base, a failed assault on the Death Star and a daring rescue on a captured Princess Leia rounded out the thematic experience.  The only downside to this game is the length, but the time flies by because the game doesn't drag.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Brazil">Excelent game. SW rebellion puts all the plots in Star Wars universe into a global theatre in game. Well, not everything, just the best part, the 3 classic episodes.  The game is huge and with very good quality miniatures, the battle and movement plays simple rules but makes the advance very slow. But the best part are the missions and the leaders that you put to play them, the leader action mechanics are good and makes this game even more thematic.  The only bad thing to say about this game is the playtime that is huge. But playing this in 2 makes not so much downtime, and you feel playing the game all the time.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">Warning: The rules for this game are a disappointment. You will need to read both the "Larn to Play" and "Rules Referrence" guides to play it correctly.  While not too complex, there are several small rules with a HUGE impact on the game if you play them incorrectly or miss using them. That said...  A 4 player game with all players having played it once before took five hours to play.  It felt a little long, but not overly so.  The theme comes across so well in this game that even the most critical Star Wars Universe fans will apprciate this game and mild fans of that universe will appreciate it. First 2 player game took a solid 7 hours and didn't have a lot of looking up rules or AP.  Onthe bright side, it was so fun we played another right after and it only took 4:40.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Not a Star Wars guy, but I rather enjoyed this. It plays like watching the movies. Negative: building/deploying was complicated (including matching symbols to see what units you produced). Missions/Objectives seemed like they contained a ton of the game - being familiar with those is probably key. But that said - this was a fun two player big ole game.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Spain">Like it a lot, and in its much reviled 4-player form.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Excellent game with a strong connection to the source material. Great art and balanced from the experience I've with it on the table. The board and scope of the game is daunting, but actually flows quite well with a good amount of strategy.  The only real hiccup is in the battle itself. While not complicated, large scale battles tend to slow down the overall pace of the game. Hopefully FFG will sell extra dice for this one as it uses it's own custom set unique to this game.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Great game!  Long to play, but very thematically Star Wars.  Go Rebels!</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Greece">Very thematic mechanics, but -and it probably is the first time I am saying this- wish for more abstract gameplay, e.g. less diversity in the cards and incorporated into the main mechanics.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Canada">Initial Impression: FFG has done it again. A highly thematic game with wonderfully produced components treats this Star Wars IP properly. This is without a doubt my favorite of the Star Wars games that FFG has produced. It's akin to a wargame but can be taught quickly and played within a reasonable amount of time for a game of this epic scale. I particularly enjoy the cat-n-mouse game of locating the rebel base. The game is a wonderful blend of strategic decisions for both the Empire and Rebellion, as well as tactical choices with a healthy dose of bluffing. Tying all actions/missions to leaders is a brilliant way to limit operations in the game, while tying the mechanisms closely to the theme. There's almost a CDG feel to this game. I'm very tempted to add this game to my collection, and probably will at some point in the future.</comment>

Seems that early game favors Imperials and late game favors Rebels.  Main reason to play with 4 is to share the thematic richness.  Rebel players need to be prepared to implement hit-and-run tactics and be prepared to move the rebel base.  Imperial faction can be unpleasant to play against.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">A great man once said: "Star wars: rebellion tm c etc. is a lot like Lord of the rings the board game tm c etc." Who was this great man? I dunno. Nvm it was probably me or will.  But anyways, this quote sums up rebellion well. You have an overwhelmingly evil, aggressive, and insidious force against the righteous Empire/Sauron. The primary moral of this game is palpatine did nothing wrong. If you play as the imperial side, you will learn that the rebels are just terrorists, trying to undo the beautiful order you are trying to build. They are constantly nipping at your heels like self-righteous chihuahas. I give this game a high rating for turning the age old paradigm on its head. This game basically made me a facist.  Is it appropriate for small children? Well obviously not, its a complex game with small chockeable pieces. But it has a heartwarming message: that people will always try to tear down great things, but you cant let the haters stop you. </comment>

Every time I play, I get the itch to pull out my second-favorite space epic. (This is not a bad thing.)  As with most Stonemaier Games, Scythe's art and components are absolutely gorgeous. The game itself is both well-balanced and fast-paced, with some interesting strategies and different ways to build an engine. My only complaint is that combat isn't quite as common as I'd like, but the threat of it is palpable and gives the game an interesting "WWI stalemate" feel. The Automa solo mode is solid&#8212;definitely a big plus for me.  (Euro; 2x)</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Germany">A great game and easy to learn. A lot of people compare it to Kemet and Terra Mystica. The analogy to Terra Mystica is a bit far fetched in my opinion since the mechanics are quite different. In regards to Kemet I am inclined to say that there are some similiarities but Scythe actually works, which is something I'll probably never say about Kemet.</comment>

    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Brazil">Great components and art. The mechanics of this game streamline a lot of other mechanics and ideas from other games and the result is a clever and beautiful game. The theme is there, but all thanks for the incredible artwork, not because of the environment or the mechanics. Great solo experience with the Automa(s)!</comment>

    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United Kingdom">Strongly euro-style 4X game with a limited number of fairly simple actions but a huge range of strategic choices.  The art and upgraded components are superb and it is an excellent thoughtful game.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="">An interesting game with some lovely mechanics, beautiful artwork, and game play that is neither too complicated nor too simple. Though it is not without its flaws.  You control a faction that has to farm resources and build mechs and buildings in order to gain victory stars. Play ends when the first person gains thier 'n'th vistory star. All players then recieve money for each building, mech, farmer and territory that they control, the amount you gain is dependant upon your poplarity. The winner is the person with the most coin at the end.  Once you understand the mechanics of the game it runs very smooth and each persons turn is very quick, the only 2 downsides I can pick with this game is that there is too little written on the encounter cards. I can see how they are trying to let the artwork tell the story but it only really works for the person that takes the card. The other downside is that I don't feel like the spending of resources is properly managed. There are 4 upgrades that you can spend resources on and 4 resources to spend. Each upgrade costs an amount of 1 specific resource, meaning that certain resources quickly become redundant. It is a small gripe but it doesn't feel right. Why doesn't a mech cost 'X' metal + 'y' oil? Why is it just metal? Why does a building only cost wood? Why not wood and metal and food?  Despite these 2 gripes it is an engaging game that is beautifully made with a lot of love. Overall it's a great game that will hit the table in the future.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">I deliberately did not pay attention to the hype over 2014-2016 and got to play this fresh. It compliments Eclipse so well as being a Eurotrash 4X game (perhaps my favorite niche-within-a-niche?), but leaning more towards the efficiency/Euro end of the spectrum, while Eclipse is leaning more towards the Civilization Game/Ameritrash end of the "middle."</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Agricola fixed. Agricola on steroids. Agricola without the frustration. This game is like pie. It's a sandbox. Many, many, many decisions, but each one feels right. So many paths to victory, yet strategy is still key. It's like Agricola without borders.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">played 5+ games, 3,4,5 players. (5p = 3.5h) first time play, we were all so excited, that we all had analysis paralysis and had to quit early.  LIKE: Lots of options, like the theme. scales player count well. multiple paths to victory. i generally enjoy "engine" games. DISLIKE: The number of options is a bit overwhelming at first. Some analysis paralysis (AP). Slightly lower replayability, after optimal build paths are found (but there are a few to explore). OVERALL: I like stealing other player's end-game bonus rooms, once you know the game well enough. Some people think it's not an interactive game, but the worker placement competition and when to grab certain scoring tiles keeps the game tense. Great game.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Great game. For me it doesn't fire Agricola. I feel they're different enough that it's worth it to play both of them.  It's hard for me to pick a favorite between the two, but I guess I would lean slightly in favor of Agricola.  Play Caverna if you prefer: less randomness (Agricola has random cards dealt at the start of the game), to know all your options at the start of the game, easier final scoring, less punitive scoring, more focused strategies.  Play Agricola if you prefer: more variability between games, less up-front info to deal with (reading all the available tiles), more balanced strategies.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Decided to finally give "Agricola 2.0" a chance as I think my wife might prefer its somewhat less punishing approach.  After a number of plays, I tend to agree that the omission of the cards tends to make the game a little less interesting.  I like how a lot of the Agricola mechanics have been streamlined, and I like the inclusion of the rubies and the adventuring mechanic, but ultimately this seems to feel a bit more 'samey' on repeated plays due to the lack of variable set up.  I'll add that the variety of buildings is such that multiple different strategies could be pursued, but yet the strategies don't feel as varied as [I]Ora et Labora[/I] for example.    This tends to be less of an issue when playing with multiple players who are equally skilled and can work to prevent a player from achieving the best combos theoretically possible in the game.  </comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="">Fun to find your way through the combos. Not easy to block certain strategies. Varied choices. Different paths to victory. Great game.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">We've only played one game so far, but everyone present agreed that we enjoyed it more than Agricola.  I'll start this off at a 7, and we'll see where it stands after a few more games!  I'm bumping this up to an 8 after getting several more games in and adding the Go7 Gaming storage tray.  The setup and teardown time is much faster than Agricola, and we can more easily just focus on playing.  (Not actually mine, but lives on my shelf)</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Finland">Would play Agricola with newcomers rather than that. At the start there is simply so many choices. After player's have played an Agricola doesn't matter witch one to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Very fun, but I think I may have a hard time getting anyone to play this with me.  Having played the Agricola IPAD app, I can understand the sentiment that this is just not as strategic without the cards.  Hopefully there is an expansion that addresses this and makes players a bit less symmetrical.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">1st play: Despite not feeling well I really enjoyed this game. It reminds me of the best parts of Agricola Big &amp; Small with more depth, more options and more brain burning. I like the variety of animals, even if I didn't use them well.  2nd play: I really enjoyed my second play of this. There isn't a ton of variability in the buildings that are available, and it makes me wonder just how much replayability the game has. It does take a while to set up and break down, so I have to be in the mood to play it, but otherwise this game is a nice compliment to Agricola. I don't see either game retiring for me anytime soon. </comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Brazil">Great game, I like Agricola very much and I'm sure the ones that like Agricola will like this one, but I don't really know if they will like Caverna more than Agricola, it depends if they like Agricola because of the struggle for food or because of the card variation. But I prefered Caverna because of the better theme resolution and everyone able to do things better than in Agricola, the game has more flexibility in rules, but it is a little bit more complex than the predecessor.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="">I played this game with the expectation that it would be everything my heart could desire in a cave farming game. I was not disappointed. Firstly, I was surprised at how very "euro" it all felt (though I shouldn't have been). It's nice to see that after repeated playthroughs, my group couldn't find a "best" strategy. Caverna's piece quality was pretty through the roof, just like its pricing and that made a difference during play. It didn't feel too much like point salad but there was enough of that to sometimes turn a game's ending bitter (the typical predictable last turn of a eurogame). The art however needs serious work. I would love to see a less "storybook" style version of this game in the future as a remaster. Overall very good, very fun, bad art, predictable ending, great component quality.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Canada">Caverna is a VAST improvement over Agricola, and I'm not really sure why. I find it more tense than Agricola, although I see that the latter game SHOULD be more tense. Perhaps I find Caverna more tense because I never really feel drawn into the "world" of Agricola, and so what tension I should be feeling in that game is lost in a sense of, "Oh, what an interesting puzzle I'm doing." I'm drawn into the world of Caverna because it feels more realistic...and yet it's about dwarves? Huh?  I like that all the information is wide open to all players: no secrets among dwarves. It looks like multi-player solitaire, but it ain't. You MUST keep an eye on what the other dwarves are doing, and change your plans accordingly (at least in the first half of the game). As John Bandettini said: "It's like Agricola, but fun"!</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="South Africa">Engaging Euro filled with gorgeous game pieces all the way to the top of the box. If you're not into farming or mining, you won't have much fun. As a worker placement game it offers little player interaction beyond competing over spots. The option to go on adventures is fun and adds more strategic options.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="">It's like Agricola, but I'm enjoying it!   Seriously. Dispenses with the parts I disliked about Agricola (how hard subsistence could be) but retains everything I did like (engine building, farm construction, a very tangible feeling of progress as the game goes on).  Might run into some repeat play issues due to the lack of any random elements and seemingly some strategies just being good in general (Beer Parlor, 6 Dwarf Rush, etc), but a solid game.  Would love an expansion.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Greece">This re-theme of Agricola is a solid game. I do miss the occupations and improvement cards. I liked that in Agricola each game was unique and that you had to plan your strategy around the cards you had. On the other hand Caverna has more resources to gather, it is less punishing, has the new expedition action and a new scoring system that I love. No more 'you have to do a bit of everything' Now you can focus in breeding only boars for example. </comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">I do not consider myself a huge fan of 7 Wonders, but this two player rendition is a proper homage with features all together unique. The card layout each age is a brilliant way to have a lively 2-player experience of drafting (a mechanic I generally do not like). The lines of building and developing seem smoothly implemented. I like how military is solved and clearly ramping up the cost of not having resources by paying what your opponent does have is smart. Nice 2-player experience.</comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">This game is a wonderful distillation of 7 Wonders into a 2-player game, but it's so much more than just 7 Wonders for 2.  The card pyramids are such a great way of doing drafting for two players as you have to think ahead several moves when deciding what to pick, and the face down cards create enough uncertainty to prevent players from mapping out the entire age (or feeling like they need to) for each pick.  The alternate win conditions of science and military, while uncommon, present ways for players to pressure their opponents into making moves they might not want to make, and force the players to diversify their strategies.  This game does the 7 Wonders brand justice, and is a standout in the crowded field of 2-player, head-to-head games.</comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Brazil">I enjoyed 7 wonders very much when it was released, but I played it so much and got over it for quite a while. The two first expansions are great and I think the game is not playable without them anymore, and I got enough of 7 wonders already.  7 Wonders: Duel has a lot of good ideas from new abilities of the leader and cities expansions mixed into a new implementation focused only in 2 player game. And guys, it worked so well. Bruno Cathala surely was a good addiction to the design team and now we have another great game for 2 players. Let's remember that the original 7 Wonders have a variant for 2 players, but it is not even comparable to this new experience.  Now we have the military strength excess work a role in the game and the science plays a little bit different in a way that it simply can win the game or put new strategies and possibilities for the player.  This new version is very amazing and surprised me in a positive way.</comment>

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Spain">The big one. Puerto Rico. I feel I have barely scratched the surface of this game. The mechanics work all too well - you really feel poor and desperate at the start of the game, by the middle you are frantically trying to decide what everyone will do and whose set up is the most threatening and then at the end there is a tremendous sense of time running away from you. A great game. BUT. It seems that to sit after a weaker player (normally me) gives a very big advantage and so to get a satisfactory game everyone must be of a simialr standard.</comment>

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">2010 - 8 Is it the best game ever as indicated by it's #1 rating on BGG?  Probably not, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a fun game to play.  As others have stated, there are, at times, "wrong" moves that can frustrate experienced players.  However, as long as you stay light hearted and remember that it's just a game, you can't go wrong with Puerto Rico.  2016 - 8.5 Six years later and PR is still a fun experience.  I don't play it nearly as often, but when I do, I always appreciate the beauty of this game.  If played with my favorite group, this one is a 10.  With a random group, probably a 7.  I figure this averages to 8.5.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="">PR is really a very good economic game!! not very complicated game rules (may need 2-3 games to know the building functions). Each turn, you just need to chose a role (out of 6 to 8), and take the action with the chosen role, huh! is it simple? not really!! since the role you chosen may affect other players, so to make a decision in mid game is quite brain-teasing!! You need to manage money and victory point in terms of building, manpower, resources.   Moderate game time, PR usually can be finished within 20 turns. You can play it in casual way as exploring the game with your land development. Great design. San Juan (card game) is recommended as well ( I have played SJ first such that I know PR easily)</comment>

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Canada">A game about building up your plot of land in the middle ages, acquiring mines, animals, buildings, boats etc. and using dice to limit your action choices.  This game is a bit of a departure for Feld in that there's almost always something good to do and its a game of point grabbing rather than a game where the game is hammering you.  Each turn you roll 2 dice which limit your actions you can do.  Actions are: 1) acquire a tile, 2) place a tile, 3) ship goods, 4) grab workers.  Points are scored in a myriad of ways: 1) animal tiles score, and can score cumulatively ala Taj Mahal, 2) shipping goods scores points on a per good basis, 3) completing regions scores as well as scores bonus points (the earlier you complete a region the greater the bonus), 4) one type of building has the function of points, 5) some knowledge tiles score for certain conditions at the end of the game such as building, animal type etc., 6) completing all regions of a one type score bonus points, 7) minor scoring of money, left over goods, and workers at game end.  Although your actions are limited by the dice, you have several options as to what to do each turn and the function of the worker tiles is to modify die rolls- a nice touch is that there is "wrapping" (6 to 1 for example).  I will say that despite this, dice rolls can be occasionally frustrating particularly if you consistently roll doubles (which I have a talent for).  The game plays 2-4; I have only played 2er so far but it works great at that number.  There are several different starting player boards which lend themselves to slightly different goals.  So far this is a very addictive and accessible game that the wife loves.

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Malaysia">Burgundy is a much more relaxing game, you roll dice, pick which 1 of the 4 actions you want to do &amp; you're done. The aim is to gain the most points while trying to fill up your player board. The best part is when you do some combos upon combos. And like Bora Bora, everything that you need to know is on the player board itself.  A nice balance between getting tiles, build them, selling goods &amp; completing the areas.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">Highly balanced, mechanically excellent Feld game. This one shows interlocking systems in a marvelous way with bowls of originality. However, it's likely only appealing to the true Euro-gamer who enjoys themeless adventures that are titillating simply because they offer up so many options with excellent rewards. I like this one very much.</comment>

Even if the dice don't go your way, you can collect workers and manipulate them in future rounds.  There are some annoying things: All yellow tiles are unique and need often to be looked up in the manual. The function of the tiles are sometimes hard to remember because the building icons are not very meaningful. The colors of the tiles are sometimes hard to distinguish.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">Wonderful game with terrible art.  I'd probably rate it higher if it wasn't so hideous on my table.  It's one of the few games that I just don't want to take pictures of and share with my friends.</comment>

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Germany">I'm awed by the mechanics and the sheer number of things you have to keep track of while managing your farm. Speaking of which: The theme is anything but pasted on - it's reflected in the gameplay very well. </comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="England">Not the gaming nirvana the rankings would have you believe but still very good. the core game is very tough and would be worth an 8 on it's own but all those cards create great variety and bump it up to a 9. I'm going to mark it down one though because I really am terrible at it and, as a consequence don't enjoy it quite as much as I could do.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Canada">Whoa!  Best of Euro-Gaming.  Seems at least 2 expansions set were included in the base game.  Well worth the price. A lot of fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">Really enjoy this game, it's a shame it doesn't make it to the table more often.  Good thing I can play it online.  I am debating on getting Agricola ACBS.</comment>

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">Update Nov 27, 2010 - Downgraded from 8 to 7 since it seems like I never want to play this game.

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United Kingdom">Might have been the first worker placement I played, and still one of the best. For me the threat of the wrong decisions potentially making you crash and burn rather than merely 'do less well' makes the game far more tense and exciting than you'd expect. Not to everyone's tastes, but it sure appeals to mine.  update 22/06/2016: as I've played more and more fresh takes on Euro mechanics my desire to play this has dropped somewhat. Still a classic, but no longer in my personal upper echelons.</comment>

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Australia">Impressive game even in the cut-down "family" version, much better with the development cards. Plenty of strategic depth, and more opportunity for player interaction than I had been led to believe. The solo game is surprisingly engaging (I usually dislike solo games). A caveat however - it can be frustrating if you're dealt a poorly compatible hand of cards, or lots of travelling cards.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United Kingdom">Great Game. Wish it came to the table more often.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">It took me awhile to pinpoint what I didn't like about Agricola. I kept the rating at 10 because I didn't seem have a reasonable reason (heh) to lower it. But when I got [thing=43018][/thing], I realized that the occupations seemed to be just added for good measure, besides being frightfully imbalanced (at least for two players, which means a lot to me). With Farmers of the Moor (sans occupations), Agricola is one of my favorite games.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">After a long break, I finally decided to give this one another go-around.  Apparently, my tastes have changed as I had an enjoyable experience.  The main draw of the game appears to be the stress of not being able to complete everything by the end of the game.  If that doesn't sound fun to you, probably pass on Agricola.  ---  (2012-10-01) Additional plays continue to produce enjoyable play experiences.  Like wine, this one seems to get better with age.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">My wife and I really enjoy it, but we're still working on getting the hang of it. I've heard it can be resource starved with only 2 players, and I would agree, though I haven't played it with more than 2 ever. On the other hand, it really makes you think about your strategy, and I do love it. </comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Spain">Not much to say that has not been already said. Another masterpiece of game design. The number of people playing it and rating it in BGG give an idea of its success. The masses embraced it in joy. It&#180;s fun, and it works greatly for non gamers. My girlfriend favorite. And that is a great plus. Had to make it to the Top 10, even if the theme is not my cup of tea at all.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">Fantastic simulation game. Feels rewarding and stressful feeding you family and making a beautiful farmyard. The cards go overboard. It can feel samey with everyone playing similar actions, but it's like no other. Definitely a fine wine. Must play.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">I like the game, I'm not sure if I love it yet.  It definitely has last appeal.  Is it better than Puerto Rico?  Probably, but I don't think PR should be the #1 game anyway.  I like the theme and mechanics, but my one real annoyance is losing points for everything you DON'T do.  Couldn't we have just gotten 0 points?  Only based on 1 play, looking forward to playing again.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Canada">After 3 games, my impression is that Agricola is over-rated. The reactions I've gotten for this from my friends are weaker than games like Puerto Rico, Ysphahan and even Dominion received. Perhaps this game will reveal more depth with time - I am not really expecting it though.   Update: up from a 7 to an 8. Ok, the game does have depth. Like a friend of mine pointed out, this is as close as we get to multi-player chess. He has a point. However, the other games referred to here are still more 'fun', imo.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Scales well enough to upgrade it a tiny bit. Three- and four- player games much more interesting than two-player. From 7.9 to 8.0.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Incredible game, best with 4, but too fiddly for desktop playing, which is how a game should be played.

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Definitely need to play this one again in the Advanced game.  We only tried the beginner game and it took 3 hours because of slow players - not a great experience.  But it left me wanting more.  It was pretty fun for a civilization game and I wanted to play it again.  If the fun goes up with the options, and if the down time goes down, I'll like it more.  Update - played advanced game.  Fantastic game, tho still very long, even with only 3 players.  I have a bit of concern that the weakest player just gets continually beat down, but maybe that's just b/c our weakest player was not playing well.</comment>

A co-op might not be bad, but I don't think I'd want to play with more than 2 players, at least at my experience level.  I could see it being decent with more if the other players have more experience so there isn't as much AP involved.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Canada">Rating based on solo game only. Haven't played PvP or coop.  I like the puzzle-like nature of the game. Thinking about things like the interactions of the cards or what cards have come up and what cards remain to be used, while also considering the timing of movement and where to move, makes me feel like I am making interesting and even agonizing decisions. Often though, this makes for long turns for me.  Yes, there will be random features such as what is in the offer pile or what tiles come up but I like the fact that you need to adapt to the situation each time, almost every turn. So there feels like a grand strategy can be adopted but it is more of a tactical game in nature so if you do  not adapt, you will lose.  It seems like playing against or with others would simply take too long so I probably won't do it.  A lot of rules to remember, especially as it relates to the monster tokens and how to defeat them, and I find myself referring back to the rule book often even while considering my options. This breaks the immersion for me.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Australia">Why I think you should play this:  *Mage Knight has a pedestrian theme. However, the generic narrative leaves a lot open-ended, and this assists in allowing you to build different characters different ways every time. Mage Knight is not an adventure game; it's a deck-building game with a fantasy theme.   *This game has been called fiddly, but it shouldn't be compared to Euros. Instead, this is Magic Realm playable in an evening. When you read it in that vein, you see the economy of components and how enormous breadth has been contained in a pleasant and functional tactile experience.  *The gameplay is absorbing. [thread=864817]Beginner strategy here[/thread] and [thread=864916]Expert strategy here[/thread].  *Patrick Carroll makes a good distinction between 'god' and 'hero' games and in Mage Knight I think you are seeing the perfect blend. You are building your hero with personal customizations, but you are also above the game, manipulating it, not falling prey to the whims of chance. The world is randomly constructed but you control what you do in it. Definitely not an adventure game!  Why I might not recommend this:  *I play it exclusively as a solo experience and as a solo game this is definitively the best. I can see playing co-operatively with experienced players, but cannot see how this succeeds as a multiplayer game. The downtime issues are tremendous, and the options for conflict between players badly written up. I think for the time this takes to play, there are many, many better multiplayer conflict games. </comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="">Magic Realm lite?  Haven't played MR, but have learned a little.  This is very lite, but it's got more substance than any other "adventure" game I've played.  Not a dungeon crawler, but a card-game with character development, really.  Interesting, long, probably fairly deep (but luckish).</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">I played this 5 times at BGG Con 2011, even though it takes an eternity to play, which for me is a rarity.  Around 4-5 hours per play, and we were playing the 'shorter' two day scenarios like Blitz Conquest, with only 3 players.  About the only long games I like are this, Die Macher, and Through the Ages.    The theme is excellent, and all of the game mechanics are exceptional.  I love the mana management, the deckbuilding, the hand management, and the wide variety of options available.  There are also tons of different scenarios, so you can tweak the game to your desires.   I love that you have options to do all sorts of things, even pillaging villages and burning down monasteries, and that these are sometimes or often good decisions, not just automatically terrible.  (Especially village pillaging, I feel is a critical part of strategy).  I ended up loving this game and wanting to repeatedly play it again, in spite of an enormous playtime, and thats extremely rare for me.

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">I initially adored this game, but after 80+ plays (many including the expansion) I've developed some gripes. I still love it because it's basically the only fantasy adventure game on the market that's not a crappy dice fest. The core is extremely well designed but the rough edges become more magnified with continued play.  My primary concern is that the competitive balance is skewed by the random factors. While there can certainly be a runaway leader problem, the games that annoy me more are the ones where you lose by only a few points because of how the monsters became distributed. Getting a grey guard in the white city is still only worth three points despite how hard it is to kill while someone else might draw a more vulnerable enemy and get more fame. I feel like the competitive game would be more meaningful if you had to win by a certain percentage of points. Honestly I don't mind that much because playing the game is really engaging and pleasant. I don't get actually annoyed at the table because of losing by a few points but I feel like it's a problem on a design level. However, it's enough to make me want to play co-op to the exclusion of competitive.  Norowas is notably more luck dependent than the other characters. He can be a beast or lag behind and you don't have a ton of say in the matter in some games.   The game is too easy at the default difficulty and the random factors become too decisive at higher difficulty levels. You need to find your sweet spot.  The scenarios are hit and miss. Dungeon Lords in particular is probably the most "fun" because you get to play with a pile of artifacts and other powerful cards but it magnifies the runaway leader problem and sucks the joy out of the game.   update: lowered from 9 to 8 because of general disinterest due to how much I've played this. You generally get into the same patterns and the competitive play isn't as sound as I'd like. This is still the best adventure game on the market but my tastes are moving in a different direction. This is my main fix for a big sprawling fantasy game with lots of bits.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">A fun game once you get a grasp on all of the decks, cards, etc. Just played the intro scenario. Can't wait to play a full-fledged game!</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Singapore">It is the movie of the Lord of the Rings in a box. The theme comes through strongly and they did not make the mistake of just making it a war game. You can win by corrupting the ring bearer or destroying the ring.  Downside is the set up and playing time is long, about 3hrs if both people know the rules and it is much more immersive to play with a painted set.  Other than that, the definitive LOTR game. </comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Brazil">Very good game, but very very long, so the game don't go to the table very often, but the feel of the middle earth is splendit and the miniatures are good, Ares is a very good company, I liked the tarot card sizes. The big problems is that the dices limit your actions a lot.

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United Kingdom">Note- I own the first edition, with the upgraded cards, and rules printed at home, that allow me to play the Second Edition, which is all I expect I'll now play. I don't (yet?) have the second edition board but as I basically have the components allowing me to play Second Edition I have checked "own". I have also painted the miniatures.  Really like this game: very thematic and atmospheric, lots of difficult choices about how and where to push forward.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Cyprus">Very good game. Maybe the best two player game in terms of depth. The problem with the game is that it takes too long to play on the first plays and it is very difficult to explain it because there is too much going on at the same time.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">Probably the best thematic game that has ever been made. It is certainly the best that uses the LOTR theme. It plays like a cross between Axis and Allies and a Card Driven Wargame like "We The People." I love how the game feels true to the storyline of the books, but allows you to explore alternate "what if" scenarios that feel like they could have happened. The main issues that keep me from rating it higher are the game's length and complexity. It isn't the easiest game to learn so if you don't have a consistent opponent to play with it can be difficult to get it on the table. </comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">I Love this game, it is Star Wars in a box.  My problem with it lies in my playing as the Imperials.  My play group takes a significant amount of time to plan out each of their turns, this works well for them but it means a typical round is: Rebels take 10-20 minutes per player, imperial takes </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Singapore">hard to get a consistant group to play the campaign. LOVE PAINTING THE MINIATURES.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">The only game that I have painted the miniatures for. That should show how much I enjoy it.  The joy of Star Wars distilled in a box. Many adventure games and dungeon crawlers can become over-full of book-keeping and die-modifications, to the point in which it can feel exhausting. Some players greatly enjoy this aspect of gaming. However, it just wouldn't feel right to have a Star Wars game with the same sort of barrier to entrance. I think Fantasy Flight has done a wonderful job of streamlining the dungeon experience and creating a game that heavily suggests the feeling of a Star Wars skirmish. The amount of gameplay and longevity is also incredible, supporting a campaign mode with enough story and progression to feel depth, as well as a fast-paced skirmish mode that is great for little one-offs. The support for the main game, through miniature expansions, is also admirable and the amount of content you receive in cards and skirmish scenarios justify the price and show that Fantasy Flight is creating win-win situations for the company and for fans.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">Theme is wonderful!  The only issue I have is that the weight of choices can creat a chess-like endgame that can take hours to resolve. Some people might find that part of the brilliance, but I found it a little taxing.  Still a wonderful game.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">Where X-Wing drops you into the cockpit of iconic Star Wars snubfighters and Armada puts you in command of entire fleets, Imperial Assault takes you right down to the adventures on the ground that are so central to Star Wars. Both sides are incredibly fun to play, with the ragtag band of heroes earning experience and accomplishing missions while the Imperial player deploys all the might of the Empire to stop them. Definitely one of my favorite games right now!  The box is also two games in one, and the skirmish ruleset is nothing to sneeze at.  (dungeon crawler; 2x)</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">I bought this to play with my two boys.  I wasn't sure how well it would work since my boys are so young (6 and 8) but it has actually worked out great.  We played through the tutorial and they really liked it.  We are currently 8 missions into a campaign and we are all having a good time.  I play the imperial side and they each play a hero.  To make it be more fair I haven't been spending my XP or Influence, but they have been spending their XP and credits (which they really enjoy).</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Sweden">FFG could have very easily taken the lazy rout and just slap Star Wars pictures recycled from their LCG on Descent and they would have made back more than their investment. I don't mean to sound cynical but that is exactly what Hasbro has done (for years) with Star Wars Monopoly or Star Wars Risk. FFG has shown love and care in this game, and it shows from the countless of flavor text written everywhere from the rulebooks to the hundreds of cards and the overall reworking of a tried and true game system. To put it bluntly: Imperial Assault is far from &#8220;Descent, but with Star Wars&#8221;. It is a perfectly streamlined and designed game that takes classic design concepts and mechanics and refines them to one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="England">Difficult to see how this could be better. I'm not even a massive Star Wars fan and I really enjoy this one when it hits the table. It's basically a further refinement of Descent 2.0.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">Just started a campaign.  We're two missions in.  I only purchased this to have a "Descent" like game in my collection.  We are really enjoying it so far, but I suspect the rating will go down after the newness wears off.  According to a buddy of mine that has played quite a bit of Descent, the games are virtually identical in their core mechanics.  This isn't getting to the table with the frequency I was hoping for, so I traded it away to someone in the gaming group for another game I've been wishing I had in my collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="">After just one day playing through a couple missions, I can see why this game is so popular, and why Star Wars fans are living in a bit of a golden age of board games. Imperial Assault has a lot of meat on its bones, and even though we got crushed by the Empire during our first mission, it was a blast.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">Uses well-tested mechanics from games like Descent or even the FFG Star Wars RPG to provide an entertaining Campaign or Skirmish experience. A bunch of missions included right in the box, and the miniatures and other components look fantastic. Firing and melee rules are simplistic, and the opposed die rolls help to mix up what might happen during a combat rather than being a 100% sure thing. The line of sight is easy to follow, and Strain and Wounding mechanics help the Heroes feel...a little more heroic than the Imperial mooks they face. Dat AT-ST though. Pain to put the gun on the nose, but damn does it look good.</comment>

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">I feel like this one has been a bit over-hyped.  I really enjoyed playing it and will definitely play it again.  There are some really clever mechanics, but there are lots of cards they are very imbalanced.</comment>

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="Canada">Really good area control game, with an awesome Viking theme and amazingly detailed miniatures.  The battle randomness is limited to a single revealed card per side, so this game leans more towards "Euro" in mechanics.  Always lots of fun!</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">So far so good... but I need to see how this pans out as we get better at playing it.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">Finally got a play this one at Gen Con with gods and mystics expansions. Great fun! I recall playing the previous incarnation Midgard and remarked how wonderful it was in mechanics. Well, it holds up well for sure - and the dress up by Cool Mini certainly adds to the flare and fun. Very fun drafting (a mechanic I find I don't often like), wonderful power ups and area/battle control where dying itself is often to your benefit! The gods expansion adds variety, so good all around. Lots of love.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">A fantastic game. While I still love Chaos in the Old World, Blood Rage has largely replaced it as I didn't feel like I needed to own both. Eric Lang really nailed the design on this one, and you can see a lot of the best elements from CitOW showing up here. The art and especially the miniatures are beautiful as well, which is always a big plus.  (area control, 3x)</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="Sweden">Intuitive game with drafting, action-point allowance system and area-control. I really enjoy playing this game even though I am not very good at it.   I like that there are many different ways to score points in this game. Some tactics even revolve around dying in a region. The skill in the game is to draft a good combination of cards and to use them at the right time. This is not easy as you also have other priorities on the map.  The game works well with both 2, 3 and 4 players. I think I prefer it with 4 though because of the more caotic nature of it. I have not played it with 5, but  I will do as soon as I get my hands on the 5th player expansion. Maybe it is better than 4, or maybe it is too much chaos. Who knows?  I am really looking forward to get more plays out of this game. </comment>

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="Brazil">Ok, i have some doubts about This one, but all here works well. Its not a Great Game, but its fun, easy an have a good playing time. The mini are AWESOME, but CMON never delivered something bad in This aspect.  WANT play more times.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">1st play: This game feels related to Chaos in the Old World, which makes sense given the designer.  The drafting is good, and the production values are amazing.  I'm not a big fan of "exclusive" content, especially when it feels like that exclusive content is probably necessary to have a complete game.  I'm not sure if it's a game that will have a ton of replay, depending on how much control over the types of cards you can get.  2nd play: This game was excellent the second time.  Having an idea of what could be played added an additional depth to the game, and the mystics were worthwhile to add.  I'm still not a fan of the exclusive content, but the game was great overall.  Drafting was tight and I saw new paths to victory I had missed the first time through.  Quite excellent.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">Enjoy the combination of 'action points' (i.e.,rage) along with the card drafting mechanism that is similar to 7 Wonders.  </comment>

Six games later and its subtlety is revealed and the game's depth, counters and mind games get really engrossing. I'm glad it's gotten better with more plays because I was worried I paid too much money for a game I didn't like.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">Awesome area control / drafting / viking / monster game. This is one of my favorite styles of game - where almost every card feels overpowered, and that's what balances it all out.</comment>

I'd say the main downside here is the strength of the "losing" strategy when playing with newer players. i.e. new players do not know to avoid/deny the losing/Loki player's strategy and often feed them a large amount of points.

The learning curve is a little more difficult than other games I've played, however it's really rewarding once you get the hang of it.  When you get near the end of the game and all the resources are in short supply it can be really exciting, and often you won't know who will win right up to the last turn.  This should be a must play for anyone into strategy board games. Just make sure you have a lot of time to play it because with 3 people on my first full playthrough we were at it for about 4 hours.</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">2012-11-04: Probably my favorite game at the moment.  However, I'm a little worried that the game has the appearance of strategic depth when in actuality only offers a few viable winning strategies.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">Not the epic flavor-fest that Twilight Imperium is, Eclipse holds its own ground with an innovative economic system that keeps everything moving and flowing smoothly. Taking up a ton of table-space, Eclipse does so many things right, that it creates a sort of hybrid experience, bringing some random elements of Ameritrash and crossing it with a highly polished Euro resource management system.  My favorite parts revolve around the technological improvements, building up a unique armada and testing it against your foes. You could also go the peaceful route if you'd like, exploring the system, hoping to find ancient alien technology, and establishing monoliths and orbitals along the way, gaining resources and VPs, without dealing in space battles. Or, depending on the number of players, feel free to form alliances and boost each other's resource income, defending each other against other aggressive enemies. Trading in your alliance for a quick grab of power will earn you a traitor card with negative VPs, but it just may be worth it if the opportunity presents itself.   Eclipse is a Euro's Space Epic. It doesn't quite bring the story and expansiveness and unpredictability of other space games, but it is an effortlessly solid and glowing tribute to the sci-fi genre.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Spain">Si conoc&#233;is y os gustan los juegos tipo 4X, &#233;ste est&#225; muy logrado, mezcla de mec&#225;nicas euro y amerithrash, que pueden gustar o no. Creo que es un gran juego, pero un 10 al marqueting que se lo ha currado de tal forma que parezca que todav&#237;a es mejor de lo que es. No justifica el juego su hype, est&#225; muy sobrevalorado, pero no esta mal. Es un eurogame disfrazado de elementos de juegos tipo 4x americano, pero el juego tiene mucha burocracia, mucha parafernalia de econom&#237;a, para al final tener varios elementos de azar muy determinante que chocan con el otro estilo euro. El juego es demasiado largo en esa burocracia, si tuviera esta mezcla, pero m&#225;s directa y simplificada, estar&#237;a mucho mejor (tener que explorar al azar, a ver que tecnos estan disponibles al azar, una vez avanzas tener que ir una a una investigando tecnos, luego tener que equipar las naves otra vez, poco a poco, todo para poder moverte m&#225;s, tener opciones de cambiar la probalidad a tu favor, y todo ello cuando lo tienes despu&#233;s de 4h de juego, un turno o 2 que te pegas de leches y el juego se acaba. No se, el dise&#241;o es bueno, pero la mezcla no acaba de ser satisfactoria.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Turkey">Very good game except for the setup which takes around half an hour :) But very good game otherwise</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Sweden">Land grab, secure borders, raise victory points, final battle. The game is constructed to attack the leading player, however, not everybody might reach the leader.  I think the game should gain from a victory points track to clearly show who leads. Hidden reputation tiles is ok.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United Kingdom">Only played 3 player and I imagine it gets better with more (although also a lot of downtime). So many decisions with so few actions, you're never quite able to do everything. The races are different enough to prefer different strategies but not to be hard counters to one another. Would probably play again, but there are better epic games I'd rather play.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">Hits the same spot as TI3, but so much faster</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">Eclipse is fun, but as odd as it sounds, it felt a little short! I played a 2-player game and right when I felt like things kicked into high gear... the game was over! It's a solid game with good mechanics, but just feels like it's over just a little too fast. Also wish there was a little more variety to the exploration.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Canada">Played once. I think it's pretty fun, but really really fiddly. A little too much dice-rolling for my tastes though. Also, beginners aren't likely to win just because it takes a few turns to figure out strategy and understand how everything goes. It's also a little long for my tastes (mainly because I can't play it as often). Still, it's a pretty good game.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">+ Fully immersive experience; You can control pretty much your whole strategy and make the necessary changes on the fly. - Must be played with players who like direct conflict (which is definitely not everybody).</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">Eclipse is a very fun war game that is on the heavier side.  Gameplay is also somewhat long but not a marathon and setup is lengthy as well.  This game offers a good balance with resource gathering, space exploration, customizing your own ships, and, of course, combat.  The advantages to being peaceful do not seem to be big enough to warrant that as a legitimate option but I also have never played with more than 4 people so maybe the diplomatic metagame provides more advantages that are not incorporated into the game itself.  Overall, Eclipse is a very good game that I really enjoy playing.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">An excellent 4x game!  I love how easy and simple the implementation is while preserving the overall complexity and feel.  Why not higher?  Well, it's still not my kind of game.  Fun, yes, but very directed.  While this is an exceedingly good game, I don't see it bringing anything particularly novel or exciting to the 4x style other than its ease of access.  A great game but not a must for me.</comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Used to love this game.  It's just not what it used to be though.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">A well done LCG remake of one of the best CCGs out there. Interesting and thematic asymmetric play. Cool hacking/cyberpunk theme. So far, I think it's great.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">This is a solid game of bluffing and engine building that is a pain to teach to new players because of terminology and asymmetrical game play.    I own the Future Proof, What Lies Ahead, and Humanity's Shadow Data Packs.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">The theme is extremely strong (so much so that the lingo is difficult to navigate at first), the gameplay is surprisingly fast, the options are deep, and the artwork is evocative of the setting. Not exactly a pick-up-and-play card game, Netrunner is a strategic battle between two players with asymmetric abilities and decks.   One player is the runner, hacking into servers to sabotage corporate agendas. They are doing everything it takes to create a high-functioning rig that will enable them to crack through any firewalls and survive long enough to have taken down a sketchy and uber-powerful company.  The other player is the wealthy corporation, specializing in gaining assets, launching programs, and establishing agendas. The corporation knows that there are hackers looking to take them down, so they must attempt to set up several servers in order to create revenue and progress in their tech. They can even set up traps and strong firewalls for unsuspecting runners.   The beauty of Netrunner is in its smooth card play and convincing lore. The feel is so grandiose and ingrained in the functions of the game that nothing feels shoehorned, but only natural considering the theme.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="">I really like it, same designer as Magic</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Been a while since this was played, but fun game and very thematic</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United Kingdom">Excellent game, however I really wish there was a basic set of 7 balanced decks that didn't need the generic cards swapping about. I'm not interested in competitive play.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Really good asymmetrical 2 player card game by Richard Garfield (designer of mtg) once you get through the steep learning curve. Thematically cool with hackers and big corporations fighting a cyber war. Art is really good too. I just don't get it to the table because I tend to play games with higher than two player counts so this great game has sat on my shelf gathering dust. I haven't kept up with the expansions and like other living card games, that can lead to less inclination for me to want to play anyway as I would want to buy the rest of the sets and learn the ins and outs. </comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">I wouldn't play now, because I'm out of the loop, but it's a fantastic game, and I'd always consider getting back into it.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">We're several games and a couple of data packs in.  I'm comfortable giving this an 8 for now, though I obviously have a lot to learn before I can really be any good at the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">I never could get into Magic, and always felt confused/frustrated at the mechanics. Android: Netrunner scratches the itch that Magic could not, and I LOVE it.  Pros: - Replayability: you can play as several different corporations or runners, each with styles of offense and defense. If one doesn't suit your personality, try another! - Depth: Holy moses. The level of depth here is great! There are an infinite number of combinations you can get in your hand, and you're never sure what your opponent will do next. Runners can surprise you with enhanced runs you didn't expect. Corps can lay traps that entice runners to their doom. It is a game of feints, bluffs, and aggression, and it works phenomenally. - Flair: This game is BEAUTIFUL. The artwork and construction are top-notch, and they really help sell you on the theme. You FEEL like a corp or runner in a sci-fi Shadowrun-type world, and it's a blast. - LCG: You can buy the base set and be good to go. No Magic-style constant purchasing of new cards. What you get in the box is all you need to enjoy the game, as it should be.  Cons: - Learning Curve: The key to enjoying this game is investing the time to understand it. Newbies will be wary and overwhelmed. Coax them through it step by step, and watch some YouTube videos illustrating how the game works. Once they see a few rounds, they'll get it. The rulebook is acceptable, but not fantastic. YouTube will fill in the gaps. Still, this is not Carcasonne or Love Letter. I've played A:NR many times, and I still find myself looking up rules.  I highly recommend it, if you can invest the time to get through the initial rule-shock.</comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Without a doubt, the best card game I've played in the deck building format.  The rules were a bit hard for me at first, but I watched a couple tutorials after and it cleared it up.  This is a must for just about everyone's gaming collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Greece">not a fun of card gaming but this is so clever and so many ways to play it , discover it ... although i can't keep up with the exp. i would bring it very easily on the table</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="">Hard to get into but fantastic.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Asymmetrical, smart, tense, funny, thematic... There are very few downsides to ANR, and most of them (like the ever-expanding card pool) are blessings in disguise.  Even just the core set has a ton of potential for deckbuilding, but chances are this game will sink its hooks into you and you will want to buy at least a few data packs.  If you don't have a partner in mind, look around your local area for a play group.  Highly recommended for any fan of L/CCGs, cyberpunk, 2-player card games, bluffing, or asymmetry.   NOTE: I am now looking to sell off my entire ANR collection, current through Order &amp; Chaos. Organized in two binders.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Brazil">What a fantastic piece of game. Very clever, relatively fast and easy to learn, despite of some complexity in some specific cases in the rules. An impressive assimetric play that both sides plays very different but anyway the game seems very balanced, of course changing the decks will unbalance the game, but choosing your deck wise is part of the strategy in LCG. The art here is amazing, the cards are all very beautiful.  See my complete review of this game here, in portuguese:  http://curitibaludica.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/resenha-completa-de-android-netrunner/</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Like Concept, this game can be figured out on the fly in about a minute by anyone who wants to join in. Unlike Concept, some more advanced (but still very intuitive) thought processes can ensure better victory conditions. So simple yet, the possibility of advanced analysis is there. </comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United Kingdom">Finally got this to the table. Great game but was a lot more thinky and a lot less party than I expected. Must try it with the timer to see if that is more fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Tableau coworker mentioned this was fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">This is actually my buddies game and I need to return it, but its so much fun! A really great game. </comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United Kingdom">This is an evergreen end-of-night game for me. Wonderful thinky party game that hits the whole gaming spectrum.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="">Really fun, quick "party game" (just like everyone says). It's easy enough not to follow the eyes of the spymaster as other reviews have complained. It's over quickly, gets a laugh, nice and social, has varients for 2/3 players. huge play ability due to amount of words.  It's not got a huge amount of depth but then it's not that sort of game. The "grid" card is a bit small but an nice app can replace that.  winnner.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="">Well liked by literally everyone I've introduced it to.  It's key that folks understand you can't win by plunking away one card at a time.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">My main complaint about this game is that it is so dependent on the group you are playing with. My group is predominantly introverts and linear thinkers. I would love to play more often but it misses with them.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Deceptively simple party/word game. So far, nothing but fun had by all.</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="">Suffers from the infamous 'one more round' syndrome. That is not a bad thing, mind you. Even non-gamers are hooked up by the game and the 'what could he possibly mean by that' deduction. </comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United Kingdom">The first game I've seen non-gamers get so involved in. It's a really great concept and a great party game that you can play with almost any number of players.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Okay, this is just great fun. Easy to learn, fast playing, great suspense. The kids will play it over and over, given the chance. Love it.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">This game is so easy and quick to learn, and it offers hours of addictive fun. You can't go wrong. I definitely prefer it with 4, or better yet, 6, however playing with only 2 or 3 people is only a mediocre experience. It's been a big hit every time I've brought it somewhere.  </comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="">A wonderful word association game that inspires critical thinking, problem solving, and a little bit of trust. I could play five or six rounds of this game in a row and not get tired. Fantastic filler game and fun from 4-40 players. </comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">10/2015 - Purchased from CSI.  11/2015 - This has been a big hit with the family at Thanksgiving.

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="">Very fun word guessing game. The go to when in larger party groups. Playing with timer greatly adds to pressure and decreases downtime.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Canada">Smart game. Best played with friends not strangers, I think, because the interplay between clue giver and players will be both more fun when guessed wrong and intimacy promoting when guessed right. Or maybe I am seeing too much into what is basically a cool little guessing game.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">+ Great deduction elements mixed with words makes everyone happy in this fast party game; The theme, which is easy to dismiss at first, is just present enough to make a difference to me. - With groups larger than 4 total players, it can become easy for one guesser to take over the group.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Great party game! Also still fun with two players.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Singapore">A very easy game to teach and plays very quick and can fit a big group. It is one of those games where a review does not do it justice till you play it. It is immensely interactive and interestingly even when it is not your team's turn you are constantly discussing old clues and planning whether to push your luck with another clue if you are leading or trailing in the game.  Downsides are firstly, the clue giver is under the spotlight and there is stress as the whole team depends on how you come up with clues. Also, more vocal players will dominate the game over quieter ones especially in bigger groups.  Overall though such a simple game but yet so good I played 6 games in a row and still would not have minded to play more. Highly recommended.    </comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Yup, I get the hype. Solid game.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Exactly my kind of party game.  Thoughtful and fun with enough uncertainty/interpretative elements to have us occasionally berating one another.  Excellent!</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Spain">Fun and rapid party game. Highly recommended.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">1st plays: Played a few games with the wife in 2p, and I was surprised at how much it plays well with 2.  I'm sure the sweet spot is 6, or maybe 4, but it really does work well with 2.  I don't know how this game didn't exist before, but it's excellent.  2nd plays: Played with gamers and 3p, as a Co-op racing the AI player.  Even better, the moments as you listen to the field agents discussing the clue and pointing at the wrong clue is so enjoyable.  The moment when you realize they've made a logic leap you didn't see coming, and trying to mentally avert the crisis.  And as the field agent, trying to figure out what the heck the clue actually means!</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">People are always excited to play this. However, not every player has to stay engaged, so usually the enthusiastic players overwhelm the bored people</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Greece">A simple idea that makes for a very satisfying team vs team game. Great as end-of-night filler.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Very fun game that I would be willing to play anytime. It's difficult to find ways to make the guesser guess multiple at a time, but it is so satisfying when some abstract clue gets picked up by your partner. Way to go for Jolly Cooperation!</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="">Best with two. We fail 50% of the time, so not that easy ;-)</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">I'm convinced there's a fun game in here... Rule book is unfortunately, terrible. Mechanics get totally in the way of the flow until you know exactly how it goes.  We house rule everything that comes up and research it later, otherwise you're stopping all the time, until you know it all cold.  Tough scenarios - seemingly great replayability. Wife will not play under any circumstances, haha.  Update - 6 months in.  Definitely enjoy it, now that the mechanics are second nature.  Love the replay value and the unpredictability.  Winning always feels like an accomplishment.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Great thematic game.  Tough as nails. I always feel that the theme comes out of the woodwork on this game.. each scenario feels truly unique and plays out differently.    I don't mind losing to this game, because I am making tough decisions and enjoy the challenge and story that we tell along the way.  </comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">One of my current favorites. Loving the thematic game style. Scenarios 1-4,6 feel balanced with a great challenge. Scenario 5, Cannibals is difficult in a luck factor way and my least favorite. Tough to teach new players as it can be very easy for alpha player to take over the cooperative decisions.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">How many bad things can happen to survivors on an island? Turns out -quite a few. I mean, we are talking about a cursed island here. Maybe it should be called Cursing Island?  There are survival games and then there is Robinson Crusoe. This isn't your typical cooperative game of trying to get the objective before time runs out. This is a slog. This is a fistfight against nature. Every decision matters and every successful die roll is cause for celebration. The pain starts early and never relents, as you lose health from every direction. That moment you build the shelter is a huge relief. When you finally get the roof up, you'll be dancing around for joy. Every moment in between is a time of nerve-wrecking hair loss.  There are six scenarios that come with the game that wildly change the feeling of how to approach your goals. However, the basic laws still apply and you'll only be successful if you prioritize well and take some risks. Playing safe on the Cursed Island only prolongs your suffering. The theme is incredibly strong, as you find yourself having to choose between food and warmth, between shelter and the wood pile, between morale and construction. The only easy decision about Robinson Crusoe is that you must add it to your collection.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Very thematic co-op game with a lot of hard decisions, repercussions, and startling discoveries.  If I have one complaint, it's that there are just so many pieces to the thing that it takes FOREVER to set up and tear down.  Still, I recommend at least trying it.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Canada">Great fun and tells a very compelling story. Love the way the card effects are somewhat tied to the actions and how they can comeback later to haunt you.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Tense and difficult.  Probably my favorite coop game, though I do get frustrated by the dice sometimes.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">three words....TOUGH TOUGH TOUGH! this game is what the tv show survivor is all about. you almost feel like you are really ship wrecked on the island as you have to make choices of exploring, hunting, building up the camp or just collecting resources to make it through the night. if you enjoy games like Dead of Winter and Legends of Andor then you will enjoy this one. There are multiple scenarios to keep the game fresh as well as being able to play solo or with your unlucky castaway friends.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Brazil">Amazing game! Tough, hard and intense!

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Germany">Really good, has two problems though: - the game has a huge coop element, which makes it possible for one experienced player to plan all the turns himself - the rulebook is written way too bad (maybe that only happened to the German edition)</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Germany">Great game. Love the survival aspect of the game and how cards you already encountered come back to haunt you once more. Really hard to beat, but always fun to play. Picked up the new edition at Essen and I still have to see if the improvements to the game kick it up to a higher rating.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Germany">A beautiful adventure game. Soloplay is very well made with Friday and a dog to help you. The island is harsh, weather is brutal and you have to build, fight and explore your way through the scenarios. The scenarios reach from building a big fire to get rescued, over a quest to exorcise the island from evil, face a volcano and even more. Fantastic stuff.     New collection. Solitaire 1 player rules.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="England">This has quite a steep learning curve because some of the mechanics are not simple and until these become intuitive it's difficult to understand strategy. However, it definately has some deep strategeies that only emerge after quite a few plays. (That Birkenhead link is several steps too far however and a great example of where Wallace - an excellent designer - really needs a good developer to get hold of his games)</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Italy">If I had to say something about this game I would say: "DEEP"! The more you play it the more you like it! Never try to judge such a Wallace's masterpiece after only one game! Even if you were well taught by a good teacher and you found the right group of gamers to play with, after your first match you'd just reach a vague flavour of the game's potential!</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Spain">Excellent game. Tight, competitive, lots of ways to win. A heavy Euro done right. On the weight scale 3.5 - 4.2 is where all the really good games sit for me.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Canada">This might be Wallace's best game- it combines the usual tough economics, route-planning, a dry yet solid theme, and multiple ways to score.  The game is divided into two halves: 1)the canal era, and 2)the rail era.  Each turn, you use cards to select two (usually) actions.  You can: take loans (necessary at times unfortunately), place canals/rails (which are required for some shipping ala Age of Steam, and also for scoring purposes), place buildings (can be used for scoring, and needed to do pretty much anything useful), develop/drill down through your building stacks, or ship cotton (if you're set up to do it).  Although the actions are card-driven, because the cards are multi-purpose, it's relatively easy to work around a "bad draw".    In the first half of the game, you're trying to get some sort of economic engine going, while still trying to scrape some points together.  You need to "flip" your buildings in order to score points for them, and in an interesting co-operative/competitive mechanic, your opponents will often flip them for you.  After the canal era ends, any level 1 buildings, and any canals are removed from the board (after they score points of course).  The rail era is very similar except that rails are more expensive to build, and some buildings may already be on the board.  Another interesting aspect is that start player shifts depending on who spent the least amount of funds each turn.  Scoring occurs at the end of both eras.    The game only plays 3-4 (I wish it played 2-player, my one complaint of Wallace games), and it is deep and may be perceived as dry.  I personally like the theme for some reason, but it certaintly won't be a draw for many people.  The rules are actually quite clear for once (actually Automobile's were too, so it looks like Wallace is improving in many aspects as a full-time designer).  It's one of those games where it's a grind, but it's an enjoyable grind- a game that needs to get more plays somehow.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">Great economic game with an awesome theme for an euro, but too many rules, it's a game for experienced players.</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">From the Reviews:Looks like it could be fun. A nice involved game and its a top 20 game so there must be something to it</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="">I've seen reviews saying that Brass is complicated and complex and that one gets overwhelmed by the endless variety of options to win. Oh shut up. While it is obviously no trivial game you would play on Christmas eve together with Granny who just had her traditional glass of punch, it is not as complicated as certain other train-related games. Agreeably, it might take several glasses of punch to understand why coal has to be transported on tracks and why iron is able to "fly" through half the country without ever hitting the occasional airplane (or cotton mill). And agreeably, it actually makes little sense to me that the game is called "Brass". However, as soon as someone else was willing to explain the rules to you, it is easy to grasp (the rule book is supposedly terrible, but not as terrible as the rule books of certain other train-related games). And it is fun to play - don't over-complicate it, just see how far you can go in taking that sweet, sweet money from your opponent who was gullible enough to think that investing in coal was actually a good idea! So really, why don't you sit down, grab some punch, and try another round?</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Singapore">In Brass, the game is divided into 2 phases, the canal phase and the railway phase.  In each of the phase, players can build coal mines, iron mines, shipyards, ports and cotton mills.  In the canal phase, players are able to build canals routes while during the railway phase, players are able to build railway routes.  Besides players can develop their their tiles so that they can accelerate their construction.  When players build cotton mills and ports, they can try to sell cotton making use of each other.  When players build coal or iron mines, players can try to sell them to the market or to use materials to for other purposes.  After ports are used and cotton mills are sold, players earn money and victory points.  Similarly when coal / iron mines are dried out, money and victory points are earned too.  Shipyards offer money and victory points after they are built.  Players can also take loans from the bank.  Good points: It is a great game.  Players can employ different strategies to win the game.  Players can build many canal / railway routes to gain victory points, or build cottons mills and ports to sell cotton to gain money and victory points.  Players can save up enough money to build shipyards which players would be able to have a huge jump in voctory points.  Bad points: Experienced players have an upper hand in the game.  They will be able to know which industry they should build first to get an upper hand.  The game also depends on the cards players drew to guarantee their win.</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">It took a fair amount of time for me to wrap my head around what the possibilities really are in the game, but once I did the player interaction dynamics became really fascinating. It's very unique and different than other Euro/Economic hybrid games.   The only other game like Brass, of course, is Age of Industry (essentially the same game system implemented in a different way). Some of the unique Brass quirks are the more restrictive city cards, the canal/rail phases, and the income bands. All of these along with the very good base map of Brass make it a strong contender for being the best entry in the Brass/AoI system--especially the canal/rail breakup.  However, I like the variability offered by AoI's multiple alternative maps as well as its usage of ships, making coal/iron the same, and opening up cards into regional cards. AoI clicks with me a lot more and just makes me want to play it quite a bit more than I would like to play Brass.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Canada">Thinky! One of the best "gamer's game" Euros out there, I'd say.</comment>

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="England">I find it hard to say whether I like this better than it's sister game Agricola. Both play very differently, of course, but both require quite a bit of thought to do well at. And the beauty of them both is that having thought it through for one game, the next game will de different either because, the buildings (or cards) are different or because you choose to adopt a different strategy. One of those games that really deserves repeated plays that the "Eurogame ethic" really doesn't allow.</comment>

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Only played this once, but had a really good time with it.  Description that I heard on a podcast that struck a chord with me was that it's similar to Agricola in that you're building you're engine, but you actually get the engine fully running for a few turns instead of it just ending.</comment>

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Wales">I rate "Agricola" above all other games and love "At the Gates of Loyang" almost as much, but have waited many months for the opportunity to try "Le Havre". I am not ready to hold it in quite the same esteem as the other games of the trilogy, and I'm not sure why. I think it is the lack of tactile components that puts me off. It has the ingenious intertwining actions of "Agricola" with the same lovely artwork, but some of the heart feels like it is missing. That said, this is head and shoulders above most engine-builders and the sheer wealth of options is admirable, with balanced and clever interplay. I think with more plays I could learn to love it, but it's got some very impressive relatives to compete with.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Poland">2010-04-14 (rating 8):  A very interesting game. Only minimal randomness just to assure every game is different. Very mathy especially with smaller number of players.  Rather small interaction between players in my opinion. This is somewhat a drawback for me since I like interaction between players. On the other hand playable in only 1 person and quite interesting int this form (this is how I played most of the games).  There is also a computer version (Java application) available here on BGG.</comment>

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">It's just so stinking quick-moving. Le Havre is simple in design, but rewarding in practice. You're never afraid of making a bad move because you're always able to get something good out of it. That's not to say that there aren't bad moves, but just that the pressure felt in this game is a fun type of pressure. There's a big build to this game as everybody is creating their empire of businesses and ships. The economy starts to expand and by the end of the game you're surprising yourself with how many points you actually earned and with the awesome layout of cards in front of you.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">3 plays, with 3,4 players.  LIKE: Great theme. Not many high-level paths to win, but so many options to choose from in the beginning. Liked the visibility of all the cards.  DISLIKE: The small tiles. Difficult to distinguish between upgraded/not upgraded from across the table. The game is a little long, even with 3 players. OVERALL: Great game! This was a game that really got me into worker placement. The short game (2.5h for 4 players) is a great way to introduce the game, but feeding seems more challenging. The PnP player mats help.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">For me, this is a solid improvement over Agricola. It plays very smoothly and feels well edited and play tested. The rule set is straight forward - all the action and interest are found on the building cards. The theme carries the game and aids to understanding effective play - e.g. wheat is turned into bread and can be used as food or perhaps sold for profit. The only strike I have against it is the time it takes to play. A 4-player affair easily takes over 3 hours - but the short version can get done in about 2. It never feels slow or dull or repetitive - so the time does move by without complaint. Still, at this point, it's one of my favorite games!</comment>

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United Kingdom">Mostly played this solo which I much prefer over multiplayer games. In solo play it feels a lot more focused and all about being efficient rather than just getting by in multiplayer. Did enjoy a recent 3 player game though, think multiplayer works best with 3.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">I like the theme better than Agricola. Overall a better game in my opinion.  Turns can go much much quicker as well if everyone knows what they're doing.  3 player game in around 2 hours.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Canada">Great resource management game.  Best when played with limited numbers of players (2 or 3) otherwise the games tends to drag on and can lay to some people getting bored.  Solo version, although not well explained in the rules, has also its share of challenges.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">I think Le Havre is a wonderful game.  It seems complex and busy with bits but is really quite simple.  The whole game can be broken down into two actions...take resources or use a building.   The depth and complexity comes from understanding the interactions of the buildings and planning ahead.  The first play may seem a bit daunting becaue you are still learning the system but after that it realy clicks.  By my second game I had a very good grasp on the flow of the game aned was eagerly planning my strategy.  It allows for a lot of variety on how you attain victory.  Being a Rosenberg game it does have a similar feel to Agricola but is quite different.  In Agricola, it seems that unless you have a perfect hand the only way to win is through generalization of your farm.  I don't have as many plays of Le Havre yet but it feels like there are many more ways to victory (of course there are common elements everyone must follow).</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">I prefer this one to the other worker placement games...</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Having just played a single solo game of this and a single two-player game of this, I think this game is fantastic.  There seems to be a lot of strategy throughout the game even if Kelly kicked my butt with 1,000,000 baguettes at the last minute. </comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Canada">Yes, it's an engine-builder; but it FEELS like a civ-building game set on Mars, and gives a much greater sense of that than the inferior game Race to the Galaxy (and mechanically, TM is  much more streamlined).   Yes, to an extent, it's multi-player solitaire; but again, it doesn't feel that way! Awards and milestones are so important that you must constantly be watching to see how your opponents are progressing.  Absolutely gorgeous game! It's very, very rare when I enjoy a sci-fi game (or engine-builders, for that matter); but as a civ game done right, this is one of the best efforts ever!</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Maybe the ultimate engine builder? A major sense of progression and building, both in your own tableau and in the shared terraforming process. You need to consider what others are doing spatially to try to max your score, and when to push the terraforming in order to end the game (or prolong it conversely), but solitaire in many ways. Still very satisfying, even in a loss or close game it is highly enjoyable.</comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Denmark">Excellent game! Very thematic and entertaining. I am not a fan of the take-that-interaction of some of the cards. It does, however, not interfere that much with my enjoyment of the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United Kingdom">A game that's absolutely steeped in the near-future science of colonising the Red Planet. Richly themed science games are rare, and most of them (looking at Phil Eklund) are more simulation than game. The game play here is rich, engrossing, and as well-oiled a euro tableau building game as you could ask for. Interaction with other players is indirect but present, either racing to complete milestones or jockeying for position on the planet's surface.  Hearing about the take-that elements on some of the cards (e.g., "remove 2 plants from another player") was a worry . I'm quite sensitive to the issue and consider it a design flaw in a game that isn't explicitly about conflict. In practice, it's usually no more than a minor annoyance. You could even make the case that it's a useful disincentive to stockpiling resources. If it still annoys you, an easy fix might be to house rule that "remove X" effects are equally distributed among different players rather than targeting only one.  The criticism about terrible art I think is much ado about nothing. I appreciate art, and found the art on the cards perfectly nice looking and appropriate to the theme. There are plenty of games with BAD art, and I don't think this is one of them. The symbols on the cards are clear, sensible, and always well explained with text.</comment>

Game played considerably easier than I anticipated with most down time spent considering the iconography of the cards. Soon we got into a rhythm and things purred along nicely.  Very enjoyable but it seems clear that complimentary cards can fall pat and result in very productive combos. Also there is no bash the leader per se as usually the aggressive cards won't apply to everyone. Glad I bought it and happy to play again.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">The gimmick of the wheel is fetching, but this game is more than that. It is worker placement - pay to put and pull to get the benefit. But the paths are quite fun and the tension is rich - always one short of what you want. It plays fast if folks plan a bit. There is a bums rush to certain scoring areas - and that's the wonderful conflict in the game. There's significant replay due to the random buildings and monuments for end game scoring. I really like it.</comment>

It's a fantastic brain-burner of a worker placement game.  I love the way the gears are built into the mechanics of the game.  They're not just a gimmick, they really make the game what it is.  The game has a deep level of strategy, but turns move rather quickly because players can make plans while waiting for their turns, and on your turn there aren't so many options as to cause analysis paralysis.  I've played with 3 and 4 players, and the 4 player game does feel a bit more crowded, but I wouldn't say this is any better or worse, just different.  If I had any concerns about the game, it would be with replayability.  There's not a lot that changes from game to game, and the number of age 1 buildings seems rather low, so you could make plans for acquiring a certain building and be pretty sure it'll show up.  This is only a minor concern at this point, and I hope to get this one to the table a lot more.</comment>

This is a clever euro that feels like it has multiple paths to victory. I want to play this more just to explore the game space and what's possible. The pacing of this game is also great, it always feels like you're involved and this game never feels as long as it is.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United Kingdom">A unique game. Currently played it just a few times and haven't got the hang of it at all yet. I absolutely suck at it but it seems pretty good.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Brilliant gateway to medium game.  The gear mechanism is more than just a gimmick--they provide for some very interesting planning opportunities.  Fun and relatively fast.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Austria">Tzolk'in is a really clever euro-game, that I wanted to try for a long time. My interest was mostly caught by the gears, because the rest of the components, while being high quality, never impressed me for their visual impact. Having finally played it, I can say that those gears are probably a gimmick, but they are also pretty functional to the smooth flow of the game-play.  Speaking of game-play... Based on what I've heard and read on line, I always though of Tzolk'in as a huge brain-burner with a pretty heavy rule-set. When I actually tried it, I was instead surprised by how simple the turns flow in this game. This is not a light game by any mean, but the heaviness of the experience doesn't come from the amount of mechanisms you have to keep in mind in order to play it. The challenge of this game is all about managing your workers and programming your moves many turns ahead... and that's the kind of heaviness that I like.  There's so many things in Tzolk'in that I enjoy: the tech-threes, the tracks of the Gods, the buildings and the monuments. All these elements intertwine perfectly to create a deep and interesting game-play. Yet what really impressed me the most about Tzolk'in is its take on the worker placement idea and its element of time management. I've never played a game before where the time felt so much like a resource. You have to manage your workers in order to meet your goals at the right time and there's even deadlines for which you have to prepare for. While this might be considered stressful by someone - and it probably is - I find it really cool and innovative.  The only complaint I have with about the game is its lack of variety. There's surely multiple strategies you can take, but I just think they don't feel different enough and you can't never actually completely ignore some specific elements, like the Gods tracks for example. Probably this issue could be solved by the expansion, which I'm eager to try. Minor complaint aside though, Tzolk'in The Mayan Calendar is a brilliant strategic game, that has a lot of challenges to offer, and one I'd like to play often given the chance.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">Game has a unique mechanic with the gears rotating the choices for the players. Food is a critical commodity both for feeding and for actions. Don't forget you can back backwards with food.</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Very nice idea that pushes the boundaries of what we conventionally think of as a board game. The included case file is quite good. My crew needed 3 run thru's to complete the Asylum adventure.   Buying new case files does add up financially. I suggest spreading the cost around to the people you normally game with.   The fan community has been stepping up with fan made scenarios that are print n' play. I expect that by early 2017 there will be a dozen solid adventures available for download. </comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Malaysia">Although we play with 5 players &amp; only 4 receptacles, it is still a great experience for all of us, everyone got the chance to become the TIME Captain &amp; involve in the action. There's a lot of moving from 1 location to another, collecting items (especially new plan, state tokens) that help, doing either deftness/glibness/combat check like in Arkham Horror. There are not as many puzzles as I would like but the clues are interlinked especially towards the final moment in the game. 5 heads are absolutely better than 1! Highfiving when solving complex &amp; complicated puzzle! Luckily we didn't fall into any mission-compromising trap though we did die, 2 times I think. And yeah, we won after the 3rd run in 3+ hours time! For all 3 runs, I used Madeleine du Tilleul as my permanent receptacle, a girl that needs constant companion all the time. Picking a receptacle that closely resembles you in real life always make the game feels more immersive. And Azidi Ismail picked the cocaine addict hahaha! Asylum is more like a training ground for TS agents, there's not much life-threatening situation (the manticore!) It feels like escape games in boardgame form, and also like watching a 3-hours movie. Would certainly love to try the other expansions!</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Finland">Played the first scenario and had a blast. I really think, that T.I.M.E Stories provides a solid platform for the most inventive and surprising adventures seen in a boardgame format. The basic ruleset seems to be rather robust while still allowing for a lot of flexibility in writing the story and designing the puzzles. My prediction is that the true potential of this game is yet to be seen, since it really boils down to the skills of the authors of the future stories. Basically the options are infinite.  So, I think it will be unfair to judge the game on a basis of a single story since the next one may be worse or better. As a matter of fact, T.I.M.E Stories is a platform while the game comes in the scenarios. The first scenario included in the base game was purely designed for one time use with no replay value whatsoever. But this does not have to be the case, since future scenarios may well stand the test of multiple plays. It is just a question how cunning the designers become. The only thing I am worried about is the amount of money needed to keep the game fresh. However, I reckon the demand and offer for used copies of the scenarios in the market will reach a nice equilibrium rather quick.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Almost done first story and bought all the expansions.   Fun stuff.  Interesting story, cool puzzles, and cool system.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Very imaginative and immersive multiplayer choose your own adventure. The main puzzle idea and artwork are remarkable.  It took us about 3 hours of play time to go through three runs on the first scenario.  Worthwhile experience, and I will play the other scenarios.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">This is a highly interesting game, but one that won't appeal to everyone. The choose-your-own-adventure aspect creates a very real sense of exploration and excitement, but the puzzle are necessarily somewhat hard and the game overall requires players to be patient and highly observant. In my play everyone was very excited the first two loops, but started to get very frustrated on the third loop.   The system has AMAZING potential though, for fan-designed modules and modules from space cowboys themselves.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United Kingdom">High quality 'choose your own adventure' style game with great art and components where you must resolve the mystery by repeated plays (up to 3).  Very cleverly done, and very absorbing.</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United Kingdom">Started the Asylum case but yet to finish. Such an interesting and unique concept, very very excited to get this back to the table and explore the expansions. I love the puzzle aspect of the game and the beautiful art.   Found the dice, and rules explanation, a little clunky so will have to have a read up before playing again.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Canada">An interesting game to say the least. The mechanics of it are incredibly simple. The challenge comes from the actual case file that you're dealing with. The included Asylum one has some neat puzzles and story that was fun to play through. The cases so far (the included one and the Marcy Case) have both been too short for my liking; wish they would have been larger in scope and told a more interesting and involved story. Still, looking forward to trying out additional cases.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Was a fun exploration game with a time-loop portion.  It oozed with theme and created a fun, relatively light cooperative game.  Would probably be a 10 if it didn't involve dice.  We got wiped on the last challenge in one turn all due to bad die-rolls, despite being at full health and having items to help us.  It isn't very fun to go through the entire mission again because of that.  </comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="England">This is an extremely well designed game. It&#8217;s not particularly innovative in its approach &#8211; use buildings to turn resources into victory points - but the mechanics that are used in this approach are sufficiently different to other games of this type for it to provide a different challenge. There is also a level of competiveness / interaction in these mechanics that is higher than in many eurogames. </comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">I've only played this a total of 2 times, but each time has been awesome.  So much variety in the game and so many mechanics in play.  Playing with all of the expansions is great!</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Another amazing mashup of mechanics that I like, especially the using resources for both bidding and action/worker payment (with diminishing returns). Only complaint is that at 6p, everyone has to be super disciplined otherwise the game drags. 2p isn't bad, but I'm more likely to either draft the starting pool of seasonal tiles, or use the Merchant expansion.   So far, the promos have all been logical enough that you can live without them, or just throw them all in and forget about it. The exception to this would be the Key Celeste which has the ghost meeple element to scare off bids. The game doesn't suffer from a diminishing decision importance (ala Terra Mystica) in that you'll find pivot points for strategy that turn up in future seasons due to the draft (especially at player counts under 4). That doesn't detract from an overall strategic form of the game, it merely requires some risk management.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Austria">Like it ;)</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United Kingdom">not much to say. if you are a boardgamer who likes worker placement you must own it. I love the bidding phase. Plays really well with two yet to try with more players but I am sure I won't be disappointed. MUST HAVE</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Interesting mix of auction and worker placement, with meeple workers used as currency and to activate tile abilities.  Lots of game-to-game variability due to different combinations of tiles available.  Fun. </comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Canada">Really great worker placement game.  Involves bidding mechanics, and has a unique twist in that people can use other player's villages.  Plays quick and has very interesting choices.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="New Zealand">Still getting the hang of this game -- need to play this more to understand the strategies. I'm looking forward to the next session!</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Keyflower is a game that sneaks up on you. It looks familiar with its hexes and meeples. It starts simple with just a small handful of familiar things to do. It has little familiar homes with little familiar chimneys and a nice familiar art style reminiscent of the coziest of childhood picture books. Then, when it gets your trust, it slaps you across the face.  Keyflower is Eddie Haskell. On the surface you're playing a little civilization game, building up an economy, putting your meeples to work, and upgrading your hexes into more beneficial properties. All the while you're whistling a tune and admiring the colorful and delightful artwork. But how did you get that property? You ruthlessly outbid somebody on it. Or you snuck in and snagged it at the last second with a color of meeple that was impossible to counter. Or maybe, just maybe, you drove up the bid on another property, only to back out and snag one that is of better use to you, just because you wanted your opponent to use up two more meeples than they needed to. You're doing it right, buddy.   Not only that, but aren't you the one who is squatting on somebody else's land? You're the one using that one property that they purchased and that would help them this round, if only because you know that it will force them to use up more of their meeples. All the while, the lands are expanding, the hexes are becoming less easy to tame and the competition is heating up.  Don't let the aesthetic fool you. Keyflower may have a certain lighthearted charm to it, but beneath that veneer, there is a complex, escalating, and highly competitive soul.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Malaysia">Perhaps the game is better with 3 or more players because of its bidding mechanism, and after understanding how each tiles interacting with each other, and also what each season will offer. Probably because there's too little stuff going on compared to Bora Bora. The pick-up-and-deliver mechanism is a miss in our 2-players game as the tile needed to transport more resources is not in play. Our game finished in 30 minutes. The gameplay is very easy, it's either you bid for tiles or use any tiles or pass, with the requirement to use same colour meeples, increasing number of meeples used &amp; no more than 6 meeples on a tile. The trick is to choose tiles that can give u the most points &amp; work well with your other tiles.  It's very Euro-ish, one of the best game at any player count, random setup which means high replaybility, main mechanism is bidding, also has worker placement, tile placement, resource management, pick-up &amp; deliver, network building, all the great Euro mechanics in 1 game! Best of Key series!</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">4 plays / 3,4 players  LIKE: town building, some tile combos, elegant game design, tense auctions. fun to figure out how to best use your army of meeples. DISLIKE: cutthroat at the end, knowing tile combos gives slight advantage  OVERALL: In autumn and winter, the game became cutthroat as we started to block each other to prevent combo scoring. as it was our first time through, getting to know the tiles and strategies was slow at first. second play was more fun, so rating could go up.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Romania">Not a bad game, but the first 2 plays have been relatively boring. it has potential for growing on me, however.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Only one play so far, but definitely stands up to the hype. Carcassone on steroids? Maybe, but it also has economics, worker placement, and resource management, while still being a medium-depth game. </comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">1st play: very impressive game. For a long time I've wanted to try this and I'm glad I did. Great spatial city building elements combined with the tile flipping I like in Brass and oodles of meeples. Bonus point for the purple waving meeple. Being able to use another player's building but at the cost of giving them future workers is excellently implemented.  2nd play: The game was still good, the workers grow very smoothly, and I approached the game from a different angle this time. I didn't focus on worker acquisition, and instead aimed to flip as many tiles as possible. I was able to pull off a victory with a couple of high point tiles. My complaint with this game is that some end game tiles are worth 30 points, and some are worth 6, and that can create some huge swings in points. But it doesn't prevent me from liking the game. </comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Brazil">I liked this game a lot. I played a game from William Attia (Caylus) called Spyrium and it reminds me of Keyflower. But Keyflower is a more deep and clever game than Spyrium (that I liked, too). With a very cool spacial building and resource management. Keyflower has a clever bidding system mixed with worker placement.</comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United Kingdom">Keyflower brings some new ideas to the well worn theme of assembling a village tile by tile, with each one producing something different when workers are placed on it.  I liked the possibility of producing using other people's tiles and those available for auction this turn.  That and the first meeple placed on a tile setting the colour that others may use, bring some interesting possibilities for screwage.  I also liked that players know what some end game bonus tiles will be and choose how many will come into play.  Knowing the tile mix is important, for instance that you will see all the tiles that produce resources in the first turn.   So Keyflower offers plenty of options and lots to consider.  I have played it three times now and it has been edging upwards in my estimation.  An efficiency game for sure, but one that brings a great deal of interaction to the genre.   Production quality is good and the artwork is quite pleasing.  We found the rules rather wordy and vague on one or two points.  </comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United Kingdom">Auction, tile and resource management game which is very thinky but an excellent game</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Greece">Very nice eurogame that mixes auction bidding with worker placement. The game runs smoothly and offers meaningful decisions to the players. While not being very innovative, it still manages to feel fresh. I also like the artwork. It took us a bit over 90 minutes for a 4 player game. </comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Interesting worker placement game.  Seems like there isn't enough variation from game to game to reward repeated play, but I may be wrong.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Scotland">Rating based on just the first couple of games, so is likely to move. But the mechanics are great, the decisions, timing, sequence of doing stuff, etc., give lots of things to think about. The randomness of tiles appearing will mean games will appear fairly fresh for ages. Looks likely to be a real winner.</comment>

DISLIKE: Shallow theme and little strategy. Cards are iconified, so looking up what effect every card does is a drag.  OVERALL: Fun game. Great for larger groups. Not sure if the leaders expansion is necessary as it adds to game length.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="England">A co-op game about Zombies? Not really my thing. BUT. This does have a very strong narrative and the personal objectives / traitor element puts it in BSG territory - and this plays a little quicker and possibly smoother than BSG. Recommended despite the theme.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="Australia">An interesting semi-cooperative exercise, with unique and highly thematic mechanics, the game sometimes lacks the tension that I find in games like BSG - BSG is always a tight race to the end, with suspicion and misdirection flying until the final reveal, but DoW sometimes tends more towards being a few rounds of loyalty checking, before everyone being more or less harmonious.  The Crossroads cards are excellent, however!</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="">I like this game a lot.  The crossroad mechanic works well as a narrative driver.  Haven't run into any issues with king making/game tanking, but the game is pretty hard.</comment>

    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Dead of Winter is a survival game with a very compelling twist. Not only might there be a traitor in your midst, but there might not be (which sounds really stupid, but is the difference between a foregone conclusion and suspense). Players are given every reason to be selfish, but they can't be too selfish or everybody loses. It's a fantastic game of motivations and shifty eyes, with a great deal of thematic flavor from the crossroads event deck. Sure, you'll probably hear the same crossroads cards pretty regularly, but you never know when a new one might pop up with a crazy decision that must be made. Dead of Winter is my co-op survival game of choice.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="">best new game...or am I the betrayer? </comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Reviewing as a 2 player cooperative (5 Rating): Really didn't live up to the hype for me. Game ended extremely quickly and far too easy. I hope this changes with more players as I'm really looking forward to playing with the betrayer element.  UPDATE: Played with more players and had a MUCH better time</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United Kingdom">I think this could be a BSG replacement for me. The personal objectives mean optimal play isn't always possible and their is still a lot to do for a revealed betrayer. The only downside I would say it that poor searchers can leave you with little to do on your turn.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">At long last a zombie game I enjoy. Dead of Winter is designed by The same person who did City of Remnants and is a really nice take on a survival horror theme. It is like Shadows over Camelot and the Walking Dead had a baby. The premise is that you are one of a few factions within a town that exists in a post zombie apocalypse. You spend your time scavenging for resources and trying to meet one of several possible scenario objectives. The trick though is that there is probably at least one traitor in your midst who has a goal to undermine the community. So while most games of this ilk capture the external pressure of zombies well, this one also captures the internal one presented by other humans. Dead of Winter, a zombie game I will play :)</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="">Thematic, fun, tense, and really difficult.  Enough second-guessing during turns to mitigate the downtime between turns, and victories feel epic if they happen (they don't happen often).  More flavor text, more survivors, more secret objectives, more community goals, this is much better for players new to DoW than the expansion, even though the expansion has more stuff and a more forgiving difficulty curve.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Dead of Winter is a very original game and is incredibly unique. As a zombie apocalypse scenario fan, this game actually didn't interest me when I saw it on Amazon. After doing some research of the game, I became excited to try it out and the game *somewhat* met my expectations. First off, the game plays beautifully cooperative, it's a constant struggle of working together to survive a zombie apocalypse. The only issues I had with the game was with the traitor and how many damn pieces are required! We had a game last about 20 minutes and the traitor had already won (maybe need to test more games but the times we had a traitor was incredibly boring). Great game, just wish there was a way to have less pieces (set up takes 30 minutes sometimes!)</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United Kingdom">Was nervous about this one (especially as I am not a fan of straight co-ops) but it delivers! Great dark fun, excellent, thematic and social game that makes semi co-op work.</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="Brazil">I think this is the only zombie thematic game I really enjoyed so far.

    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="Romania">[b]23.10.2014 - After 4 plays[/b] [b]BACKGROUND[/b]: For this game, I feel the need to explain my gaming background concerning this type of games (cooperative/zombie). Although many games played a long time ago, the cooperative genre is not a preferred one for me. In fact, I find "OK" only Pandemic (a classic of the genre) and Eldritch / Arkham Horror (mostly due to the theme). The other games I have played are ranked as "meh" - Battlestar Galactica, Shadows over Camelot, Robinson Crusoe and Red November. Regarding the "zombie genre", the only game that I have played is Last Night on Earth and I thought it was weak.  [b]GAMEPLAY[/b]: Dead of Winter is set in a small colony of survivors/runners from the zombie apocalypse. Every player controls a team of survivors (starting with 2), each having three basic stats and an ability. There is a main objective which needs to be completed, as well as secret objectives for each player. A player must complete also his secret objectives in order to win, with some objectives being "betraying" ones. Furthermore, each turn a Crisis needs to be faced, which can have brutal consequences if failed. But what makes the game shine are the CROSSROADS cards, some random and thematic events that MAY be triggered by the player taking his turn.  [b]ART/COMPONENTS[/b]: The art is gorgeous, almost black &amp; white with some color highlights (especially the bloody red). The components are nice, especially the cardboard "miniatures" of the survivors and zombies. There is just one thing that bothers me: why did they make the non-colony location from thick paper, instead of cardboard as the colony map?   [b]DIFFICULTY[/b]: If someone listens to the complete rules explanation, she may find the game is very complex (there are over 10 actions a player can take) and with many rules. Despite this, the game is easy to grasp and with someone "watching" over the colony phase, it can go very smoothly. The scarcity of the resources, the constant zombie threat and the need to complete the objective make up for a tight and very "stressful" game.  [b]THOUGHTS[/b]: There two reasons why I like this game and will continue to play 1. It is a SEMI-cooperative (due to the personal objectives), SEMI-ameritrash game (it has dice, but they are rolled just at the beginning of the turn, instead of every time you have an "encounter"). Because of this "semi" nature, it can attract different people, even those that usually don't play these genres (like myself). I think that the "betrayer" element is done excellent in this game, compared to BSG and other games with hidden traitors.   2. It is VERY thematic. Almost all of the actions can be explained in the context of the story. For example: you need to roll an exposure die (D12) every time you move a survivor or attack a zombie. The results may be: BLANK (nothing out of the ordinary happens) | FROSTBITE wound (you traveled/fought too long in the snow, so some parts of your body got frozen) | WOUND (you tripped/zombie fought back, so you are wounded) | BITTEN (the zombie transformed your survivor, so you lose it. On top of that, if there are more survivors present, each one may get bitten by the "new" zombie). Also, the Crossroads cards shows you glimpses of the story, with hard choices to be taken.  I didn't like that, near the end of the game, it may become clear if the main objective can be fulfilled or not. If not, then the non-betrayers have just one option - to exile the betrayer so that he doesn't win. This is a little anti-climatic.  According to Plaid Hat Games, this is just the first game of a family of games that uses the Crossroads system. So, I cannot wait to try the others!</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="">Fantastic coop game. Yes, there's a lot of luck needed in the game (especially regarding your secret objective card, which can be either a walk in the park or devastatingly difficult), there can be quite some down time (which I generally hate), but each time you play it's just a blast. The crossroads cards are great, the theming feels right and really helps the mechanics, the strategic options are diverse, the variety in each game is wonderful (various missions, other starting characters, new crossroads...). It's truly a fun game to play.  Theme (artwork/story/...) 2/2 Gameplay (smooth play/player interaction/strategy&amp;tactics/depth) 4/5 Fun factor (can you afford a smile during play?) 3/3  </comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Canada">A "gamer's game" with no luck, multiple paths to victory, and alot of very well designed interlocking ideas/parts, despite the generally unoriginal theme.    This is a placement game, where you have to make tough decisions (including economic) as to where to place your workers, and they cost money to place, which is tight through alot of the game (potentially).  Do you collect resources (essential for building), do you build buildings (useful for scoring points, generating more points when others use your buildings, and provides a cheap building location for yourself), do you work on the castle (required for scoring points, and gaining royal favours, and also required or you lose points), do you try to rack up royal favours in the joust square, do you want to dirty other players (or prevent yourself from being dirtied) by controlling the provost, do you even have enough money to do anything?    The tight economics, tile-laying strategy, resource management, perfect balance, and multiple options make this about as deep as it gets for a Euro.  The only real negatives are that it's a bit long (this can be bad when you're 30+ points behind, and there's an hour left to play), and although it plays 2-5, and is an outstanding 2-3 player game, you have to force me to play 4 players and I refuse to subject myself to a grinding 5-player game.</comment>

Caylus is maybe a touch heavy for my typical playing preference but the fact I am willing and interested in playing this must account for something.  This really is the only WP game I'd happily play.  Though I still dislike the mechanism such that I haven't felt the need to purchase the game....  120102 I like it more and more every time!    After playing a few other worker placement games, I've come to really appreciate how they kept the mechanisms streamlined to be primarily focused on just the worker placement and avoided adding too much area control or set collection.  Just a beautifully balanced finely tuned game.</comment>

Love how players can pass on their round to increase the action cost to others. DISLIKE: if you are new, the combo strategies can be used against you. Lots of little rules with the building. OVERALL: Great game, worthy of it's classic status. I felt the 5 players was great. My first game was fast, the Provost rarely went backwards. The game can get cutthroat, which increases the interaction, but could frustrate some players.</comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Finland">2008/06 A game with a lot of tough decisions. My GF's favourite game.   2013/01 Update - Caylus was one of the first meaty games I picked up and I still love it. I'm a bit hesitant to put it on the table, though, because it is prone to dragging on forever. If everything goes well, a game can be finished in less than 2 hours but I've witnessed over 5 hour games, too. Should that happen, it kills the game completely.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United Kingdom">I'm really split on this game.  I'll see where my thoughts go the more I play it.  So far, I've actually enjoyed it and yet...there are a few things about it I normally don't much care for in games: lack of player interaction (there's only the possibility of stitching another player up by combined Provost movement), overly puzzle-like game play, systematic procedures, lack of strategy (there's plenty of short term planning and the chance to have a starting aim - eg I'll go for gold or Castle building - but that's it).  Like most of this sort of game, keeping on top of your money supply is absolutely critical.  Other negatives are that some of the artwork is really dull and the game takes too long...3 to 4 hours depending how much AP there is.  If this was playable in 2.5 hours, it would be better for what it is - still, I suppose we've got Pillars of Earth (which I found vastly inferior) and Yspahan (which I like) for that.  And yet, I did like this, so what gives?  It must have something to save it from those faults above.  Hmm (scratches head)...I think it's the fact that there is SO much to think about.  Ok, so it's a bit puzzle-like and there is a system (buy this to get that), but even so, within that there seems to be a labyrinthine structure which I quite enjoyed.  And I like brain-burning games if they're not too unforgiving (that's where AoS falls down like a building in an earthquake for me).  In this one, you're never quite sure who's going to win because you can look behind and then come from nowhere.  Certain paths are slower burning than others.  I like that unpredictability - it makes up for the fact that there is no randomness in this (save for the set up).  So yeah, the game is a bit like problem solving, and normally that can be very dull, and yet, the problem solving here is so intriguing that I ended up liking it despite myself.  Even so, if the game was quicker and had just a wee bit more interaction, it would rate better for me.  A little bit more play has seen me raise this from a 7.5 to an 8.5</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United Kingdom">2 games so far but really enjoyed the game. </comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Romania">Very challenging, lots of intresting decisions to make, no downtime, and the best thing: Luck factor is ZERO. Not even the player's order is left to chance.  Great game!</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Hungary">Nice game, but i somehow liked Agricola/Puerto Rico better. 3 games of the same kind were too much.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="">My favorite worker placement game. The concept of the game is wonderful and the way each and every building and piece is placed on the board is brimming with flavor. Despite a long and complicated set of rules you are not always going to be doing everything at once and most of the phases of the game are far more simple than they seem to be. If anything bad can be said about this game is that there are often moments where someone is bribing the provost to screw over another player, but just the fact that you can bankrupt yourself to guarantee another player doesn't jump too far ahead is amazing.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Canada">Cut-throat resource management/worker placement game. I enjoy it every time I play, what a wonderful game!</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Does not seem to be as heavy as the reviews make this game out to be. Lots of decisions but a manageable amount. Good play and moves along nicely. </comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">After the first play, I haven't heard this much discussion about a game ever.  I consider that a VERY good thing. We'll see after a few plays if it gets my first 10.  Second play, still lots of discussion, but one player did mention too complex for his tastes. I still really like it and want to play again.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Portugal">Very nice Eurogame aka German Game.  At first time Easier to play than to explain.  Asolutely No thematic but all mechanic.  Much interaction between participants.  With Puerto Rico and PowerGrid my favorites.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Muy bueno y tensionante.</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Its a good one, definately warrants multiple plays just to try out all the possibilities.  In a stroke of genius they printed all the costs/benefits for actions and effects on the board which really helps. </comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United Kingdom">Bag-building worker placement game that made me wonder why no-one thought of this before. I'd read the rulebook before and the game seemed interesting enough, but it wasn't until it shot up the BGG rankings that I gave it a go. I was really taken aback by how FUN everything turned out to be. The different tech options available, the thrill of drawing from the bag, the shared goals being more for bag thinning than scoring... as the turns went by and it all came together I knew we had a winner here.  At UKGE 2015 I took a punt on Istanbul and ended up really enjoying it. In 2016 I took a punt on this and I love it. This game has cemented 'taking a punt' as my annual UKGE tradition! (Though to be fair, I skewed the odds in my favour by picking SDJ nominees / winners...)  edit: as much as I enjoyed my first few plays I can't help but feel I'll end up doing most of the same stuff from game to game. Maybe I need to force myself off piste and see what happens</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Sweden">Lots of freedom and very little downtime. This game has a good tempo to it. There's two reasons it's not a 9. Firstly it's a little bit too open/sandboxy to fully satisfy my taste. Secondly it's so non-confrontational that it almost feels like playing solitaire (it makes games like Suburbia and Race for the Galaxy, both of which I love, seem like all out war).  I have to point out that I strongly disagree with the people who talk of this game as having a significant luck factor. It might seem so after one play or two, but it's really not that hard to stay in control. You can let pieces stay on the board instead of forcing it to play as many actions as possible each turn. That way you you can plan ahead and keep the randomness slightly lower. You can also get rid of discs by doing good deeds.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Germany">Great bag buidling system.  8.2 Points only with   1) the official correction for the "Badehaus"       2) Harvest house rule, which creates some extra tension and makes weak bzuildings stronger: You have to pay one food the first time (normal rule), but 2 the 2nd time and 3 the third time. No harvest event can follow directly another harvest event (in case, reshuffle and draw again)  3) in case of not enough coins left to pay out an event, don't pay out to anyone (instead start player first). Alternatively play with unlimited coin supply  4) free promo Tiles "Tavern" and "Depot" included in the game   Still rooom for improvent in several detals and the buildings (cheesery and hayrick much too weak e.g.)  Could rise even to a 9 with expansion, if some details like the above are fixed and potential in buildings and events is better used.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Malaysia">Orleans is quite a thinky game, with everyone racing to recruit monks, taking the tech gears for discounted workers requirement, advancing on the development track for final scoring, completing beneficial deeds for more coins &amp; citizens, travelling on the map taking goods &amp; building trading posts. </comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">This one really hit all the marks for me.  This bag-builder is really done right.  Great tension.  Good interaction level.  Lots of meaningful, entertaining decisions.  Yes, it slowed down a bit at the end, but it never was tedious.  Loved the design and mechanics.  Good production values.  A keeper!</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">LOVE IT!  A bag-oriented, worker-placement deck builder.  And so well done!  My biggest criticism is that some directions/strategies are just inherently more powerful than others.  This includes some of the buildings as a few of them are just plain *better* than most of the others.  I know, you can knock some of them out to force variety, but the bigger picture of the game shouldn't depend on the players balancing out one another's strategies.  It may be that the expansion fixes some of this?  Not sure yet.  Rating may improve with additional plays/exposure.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">It's intuitive, the bag building and building construction, as well as the manipulation of workers in your bag provide a really tactile and satisfying sense of progress. There are a ton of options but its never overwhelming, just super super satisfying. Will need to pick a copy soon!

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United Kingdom">Really enjoyed a play of this Euro, lots of options, quite a bit going on but it hangs together nicely.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">Played this a half dozen times the last two weeks and I am a bit obsessed with the game.  My last session involved a strategy that completely overwhelmed my opponents. My guess is that it is not as dominant as it seemed, but was a function of a bit of good luck and lack of competition from my opponents for the actions I was focused on.  Just an 8 for now but will go up unless future plays become too stereotyped.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="">A tile drafting game that feels fresh, original and amusing to play.  I had a lot of fun playing it for the first time.  Orleans feels like a mellow combination of Dominion and Castles of Burgundy with additional "special buildings," "traveling on a map and building houses," and climbing on the various bonus tracks to get benefits.  Bottom line:  I think Orleans is a fun, worthy addition to the euro game library.  Should be in the top 200 at least.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Canada">Very interesting game with some neat mechanics. Bag management is important to avoid constantly drawing unwanted tiles. Wish there was a little bit of player interaction.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">The bag building in this game adds a layer of fun and chance that you don't often experience in comparable Euro games. The actions are all smooth and intuitive, the only learning curve is just remembering what they each do, learning the tiles and how you rank up along the various tracks when claiming the different worker tokens. Cute art, and this is ultimately a good medium weight game for those who have 'graduated' from gateway worker placement, say...Stone Age, with the bag mechanic here replacing that minor element of randomness from the die rolling. Believe the hype, this is worth your while.</comment>

    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="Greece">An innovative take on the "worker building" mechanic, introduced in "Archon" by sot07. This is a full game experience with many different aspects, and it needs at least 2 plays to be able to grasp the strategy, as it is possible for some workers to become obsolete after some turns.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United Kingdom">Great game and apart from the initial board setup, it is purely strategy with no random chance involved.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Singapore">A deep game that does not disappoint strategy and theme wise as usual from Splotter but this is probably the best game in my experience that they have produced. Not only does everything immerse you into the idea of running a food chain but the strategy you go down can sink you just like in real life if one lacks the ability to adapt to a changing market. The rules are the biggest surprise as usually Splotter games are very complex to teach but this game was quick and easy to learn for anyone of a regular boardgaming level. And the way of choosing facedown by each player the length of the game by the variable amount of money in the bank needed to exhaust to end the game adds a whole new level to strategy than just a standard amount of turns. Also, running a food chain is a unique theme that is fun to roleplay if one is so inclined.   Downsides is the game can be brutal and one can find a downward spiral of dropping behind the leader if a decision was not thought out far enough. The game also takes a while to play, 2-4hrs depending on player count.   In conclusion, a great game with immense theme and strategy to boot. Can't recommend it enough with it's cool theme and fun gameplay. </comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Brazil">This one is a very good surprise. Ok, not so surprise at all since it is a Splotter game and what I played from them (Just Antiquity) is amazing. They really know how to hit the people. This game has a lot of paths to make your way to the top and a lot of information, the game is punishing, but in the end it is very fluid and usually you know what you want to do. I played 2 times and I'm very satisfied with the results of my food chain. </comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Italy">Food Chain Magnate is an economic gamer's game about the fast food industry, set in the United States in the 50s. It has two main mechanics: it is a drafting game, where each player must react to others' actions and the objective becomes manifest while playing; but it has also a very strong spatial element, conveyed by a modular board (giving each game a very different feel). It has a steep learning curve (and mistakes are paid harshly: the game is very unforgiving!) and the downtime between turns can be quite long. Apart from these drawbacks, it is a very very solid economic game, with a sandbox approach. One of the best of the past year.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Canada">Initial Impression: Although the components of this game feel like one step up from prototype, I like the clipart used for the cards and absolutely LOVE the menu Player Aid. This is the way all games should do player aids. Overall, this game has many interesting decisions and paths to victory. Not only is player turn order important, anticipating opponents' actions is vital to acquiring milestones. This will undoubtedly shape your strategy throughout the game. I've only played once so far but find myself frequently thinking about the game and the  possibilities it provides.</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">Initial impressions:  Interesting game.  The most superficial complexity I've seen in a Splotter...ever, or perhaps on par with Antiquity.  This is probably a deeper game, which is a good thing.  Many aspects of other Splotters are present here, the most obvious being from TGZ, but major overlap also with Duck Dealer.  The hand management system would be better with a +1/+2/+N number at the base of the black cards, so you can simply mentally think 3+1+2+2=8 cards, rather than forcing a summation of N-1 approach - it's just an extra bit of overhead mental arithmetic when I'd rather focus on the game.  Similarly, either a player board with the milestones and cubes/squares to indicate which ones you have rather than a handful of cards which can be hard to see in a glance, as well as a board to track how many waitresses and price discounters and drinks/food a player could maximally play, would help a lot.  But perhaps the components for these would be cost-prohibitive.  I found the components and color palette absolutely gorgeous here, from the board to the menu to the card art style.  I'm really not sure what anyone has to complain about.  I've had some difficulty mapping restaurants to their owners however.  As for the game itself, there is a good deal going on - there are a lot of tempo plays and long-term strategic decisions early, which shifts to an almost entirely tactical game with few decisions for the last 3-4 turns as you are carried by the momentum of what you have chosen at the start.  It's all just posturing and trying to eek out that small edge over the competition at this point.  Milestones are incredibly important, some are so important that you can lose the game simply by not achieving one in time, depending on your focus.  I'm not sure how I ultimately feel about these, I'm never much of a fan of all-or-nothing mechanics.  It is the weakest part of the game for me.  I would rather see something where you the first to achieve gets the full bonus, then the next turn "half" the bonus, and finally it is removed.  Anyway, it is an interesting and exciting game which will warrant exploration for a dozen or so plays, at least.  Rating could climb to a 9, or could drop to a 6, depending on how my dissatisfaction with the milestones progresses over time.  Probably not going beneath a 4, probably not going to be in my top 10.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Denmark">I had been looking quite forward to playing this as it has achieved almost legendary status in heavy eurogame circles in no time at all.  Be aware that this game is a major tablehog! Be aware that this game is unforgiving! For instance, the guy who first gets to earn $100 get a free CFO, which increases his earning a further 50% on subsequent turns. No catch-up mechanisms here. If someone is pulling ahead you need to focus on eliminating his income possibilities.  I find it quite interesting that an economic game like this can be meaner than many of the ameritrashy games out there.  Anyway, this an extremely well designed game that plays differently to anything else I have tried. It is mechanically simple, but you have a ton of options and timing your actions properly is difficult and brainburny. Recommended for heavy gamers, but probably not for most other people.  Preliminary rating: 8</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">I like the idea, especially how players build their management team and I look forward to exploring that more. Overall, I'm not sure this will be a game that I am excited to play over and over again. It is very long and also includes a heavy dose of confrontation and "stealing" near the end. The stealing has more to do with adding products to stores to lock others out of selling to them. I can handle that just fine, I'm just not sure I really want to deal with it. That's especially true when the game lasts 2+ hours.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">Very pleasantly surprised to discover this game of trade routes. It's partially a dice game so it satisfied an urge to play Troyes. It seemed inspired by Hansa Teutonica although, dice. It wasn't fluffy and I'm very interested in playing again to move from preset beginners game to more variability in different city bonuses, characters and city cards. Variable paths to victory and a tight 'economy' to get it done in. Extra camels are the raw resource for travel but are critical for those bonus actions - especially the bonus die.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">6 plays / 3,4 players  LIKE: The individual player powers break the game and make it very interesting. Lots of choices and not many rounds to do it, keeps the game tense and interesting.  DISLIKE: Some player powers are boring. Analysis paralysis will stall the game because there are combos abound, especially late game. Lots of iconography, but after one play it gets easier.  OVERALL: This is the type of Euro I enjoy most. There are no new mechanisms, it's all standard resource conversion, but the presentation and game breaking characters make the game exciting and fresh. My only worry is that becasue there is little player interaction, not sure how much replayability is here. </comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Canada">Believe the hype! This is a marvelous game with unending replayability. I have only two quibbles with it: -while the rule-book is great, and the player aids are helpful, I do wish reminders had been added to the player aids about the "extra" costs for the various actions. -not too surprisingly, VMP is very AP prone, which can lead to major problems. How?  A player can use up all of his dice before the others, and sits out the rest of his round. If he has one or more AP-prone players still playing that round, the player may have a long, tedious wait before there's anything to do again! You've been warned.  For a euro, Voyages of Marco Polo is very well-themed. I don't know what it is with Italian designers, but they seem to have a talent for wedding historical theme with mechanics.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Spain">Quite good eurogame with dice placement mechanics. Like it a lot. Replayability seems to be assured due to the different seutp for every game and the character selection. </comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">Great dice management game, though my copy's been living at a friend's house for the last couple months.  Characters are very different which is great, action economy is solid and the way traveling works is pretty nice (though I think the middle path is a bit too expensive).  Haven't played enough to get a feel for character balance, though I think it's about right.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United Kingdom">The last few years have been lean times for me and the eurogame, all the more so for me and Hans im Gluck.  The last game of theirs that has stayed in my collection is Egizia from 2009.  At first glance The Voyages of Marco Polo didn't look promising.  The board has a clutter which suggests that Rococo style of modern euro design where even the bells and whistles have bells and whistles and the points all have salads.  Happily, in this case looks are deceptive.  The goals in Marco Polo are quite straightforward; fulfil contracts and establish trading posts in places that secret objective cards require.  Marco Polo's interest lies in how you go about these things using the special abilities of a character and of cities where you have established trading houses, and in what you prioritise.  What drives the game is a system of dice placement that rewards being first to select each action.  The secret objectives, characters and city bonuses are all variable so this isn't a game that is solveable.  What's more, while there is no direct player interaction, the action selections of other players will certainly have you recalculating your priorities again and again.   The gaudy box excepted, the artwork is quite good.  Production quality is decent, although the die-cutting could have been better and the self assembly box insert is pretty crap.  Judging by the size of the rules forum, we weren't the only ones left with questions.   </comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">I really like dice placement. This game hits all the right notes for me - dice placement with mitigation of the rolls, medium/soft worker placement (you can still go where you want, just might cost you more), and super interesting special powers.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Belgium">In the genre of worker placement games, there is quite a lot of competition. This game is above average, and can be enjoyed both by more experienced players and people who are new to the genre.  There are dice in place so there is a bit of luck involved, but in general, there are more than enough options to play. In a way, you can compare it to Alien Frontiers, another dice / worker placement game that I really like.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Canada">An interesting dice placement game that requires planning right from the start and sticking with it from beginning to end since the low number of turns really doesn't let you dabble in the various ways without completely falling behind. Variable player powers and random board setup help give the game a fresh feel each time you play. Not QUITE what I was hoping the game would be but certainly fun to play.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">Great dice placement game, takes a lot of what I like about titles like Alien Frontiers or Troyes and then applies it to a solid trade theme, with the depth that you'd expect from the Tzolk'in design team (though this is slightly more accessible). Good components, good artwork, and I really dug the varying abilities of the characters, which ensure that there will be a lot of replay value to this as you explore strategies with each. Also like that you can generally place dice where another player has already played, only it will cost you.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Netherlands">Took four games to get past the feeling that I barely knew what I was doing. It's [i]hard[/i] and mind-bending far beyond what the game looks like (echoes of Agricola there). All actions are expensive, you never have enough of any resource, and at the end of a turn, you frequently have left-over dice you don't quite know what to do with. Starting to feel very well put together, and invites playing again to try and figure it out more. Speeds up a lot after the first few plays. I suspect I'm going to be extremely impressed at how well balanced the different characters (with asymmetrical abilities) are. Lovely artwork and tactile pieces. Lots of attention to detail.  Can be extremely frustrating, though, when things just don't come together, while players with a good start will seem to snowball ahead.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Spain">Marco Polo offers you a lot of different ways to play.  Not only during one game, but the thing is that due to the random set up and the character selection, each game can be really different.  I personally don't like this fact that much, but I understand that many people love the idea. The dice mechanism is quite interesting. You can certainly play A LOT to this game without repeating strategies.  It looks really good, and it really takes about 20-25 minutes per player.  Even though there are quite a few choices, I think they are well integrated and is not difficult to grasp the game.  I guess this will be a hit.</comment>
    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Germany">This is one of the most fun euro games I've played in 2015. The game-play is sleek and has a nice flow. Completing contracts and traveling to different cities never once felt like a chore. Not to mention the unique character abilities in this game is balanced in such a geniously rare manner.   Brilliant game that deserves all its accolades.  </comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">This game is a blast! But it is long. 2-4 hours. Our first game took 6 hours, but the theme and game events kept it interesting that we all wanted to continue playing!</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">If you have ever so much as pronounced "Cthulu", you need this game.  A slightly lighter weight version of Arkham horror, this game is still rich and complex and very Lovecraftian.  There's much to love about the game, starting with it's overall look and feel.  All of the parts are sturdy and of high quality construction, while also being beautifully designed and colorful.  This is one of the few games (perhaps along with Cataan) that we enjoy setting up almost as much as playing.  Once you're into game play, EH becomes very immersive.  First, there are all the characters complete with back-stories, special attributes and personalities.  Then there are all of the monsters against which intrepid investigators must fight.  Pulled from the pages of Lovecraft, there's something satisfying about challenging these Ancient spawn, even when you lose (which will be often: see below).  Finally, there's the necessity for co-operative play -- a mechanic of which my family is particularly fond.  Even with all of the positives ahead, do not undertake EH lightly.  Set up alone can take 30 minutes or more, particularly when players draw out character selection and team balancing.  Second, there are multiple steps and actions for each player per turn, often resulting in events that may, themselves, take multiple steps to resolve.  Then there are all of the missions players must fulfill before they get the chance to face the big boss.  If I can sum it all up in a word to describe the game, it's this: long.  And what's a long game worth if it's not also&#8230; hard!  How hard?  Well, players in this game often DIE, as in dead -- no longer able to function and lose all the stuff you just spent an hour accumulating -- dead.  Sometimes players get the pleasure of dying twice having taken up the fight in the form of another investigator.    For some, the thought of playing a game for hours that they are very likely to lose just doesn't sound attractive.  I can understand.  If you're not rewarded by the game's atmosphere and immersion, then you're likely not to come back after your first epic beat-down.  If you stick with it, however, and just enjoy the ride, there will come a time when you are there to see an Ancient fall.  And that, my friends, is sweet, sweet nectar!  Overall, Eldritch Horror is a realistic, deeply engaging, sophisticated game that can deliver hours and hours of entertainment.  Find willing and committed gamer friends, get out some candelabras, creepy music, and plenty of snacks, and make a late night of Eldritch Horror as often as possible. </comment>

Having individual decks for GOO's is nice. Also, the game is nice and streamlined compared to AH, and takes a lot less time for the same kind of game.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">Streamlined Arkham Horror? I must admit my first play of this went far longer than I would have thought possible... but am willing to give this +many+ more chances.  I expect my rating of this to rise over time.  [b]UPDATE:[/b] This is still a long game. While it's not as lengthy as Arkham Horror is, it's deceptively long... which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What's far more important is that it's an enjoyable experience -- even if damned frustrating at times.  Have had heads handed to us every single time it hits the table -- and it doesn't matter. It's still fun!</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Brazil">O tema do jogo me fisgou, ent&#227;o isso pode influenciar minha nota. Apesar de ser considerado um jogo mais leve do que seu irm&#227;o mais velho Arkham Horror ainda &#233; um jogo bem pesado para iniciantes. Jogar com mais do que 4 pessoas &#233; dedicar pelo menos 3 horas - o que torna esse um jogo-evento e n&#227;o uma coisa para ser jogada casualmente. As regras s&#227;o complicadas para um "n&#227;o-gamer" e &#233; bom voc&#234; ser um bom organizador de jogos se pretende jogar com gente que n&#227;o conhece jogos modernos/pesados.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">A game in which you can never do enough. Nothing is easy in Eldritch Horror. Just when you've put your thumb in one hole, preventing a leak, another one opens. What could easily become a frustration is tempered by the exciting pace and weird tales of Eldritch Horror.   Frustrations give way to small victories and satisfied fist pumps when a monster is defeated or a gate is closed or a rumor is stamped out. Passing a test when your life is on the line is a burst of excitement that many games lack.  I will say that you have to be in the mood to play this game. Be ready for frustration, for bad rolls, for doom to progress when you least need it. And make sure your companions are ready for it. If there is anybody who would rather check the time on their phone than listen to an event unfold, you have a recipe for a long and bothersome game. The mood must be right. But when it is, you've got a fantastic time ahead of you.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">Such a fun game! Once you figure out the rules (it took me a while), it's pretty easy and intuitive to play, although I don't always win. It's pleasantly difficult to beat, but always fun to play. It's an aesthetically beautiful game as well. I love the pieces, the cards, and the board. So much better and more streamlined than Arkham Horror in my opinion... less clunky. I also love the worldwide adventure element. Very glad to have added this to my game library. :)</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Canada">Really enjoy this game. Much, much better than Arkham Horror (far less fiddly, somewhat shorter, just as thematic if not more so). Great as a solo game.</comment>

Pimped out with stands for Gates &amp; Monsters and bought all the pre-painted figures from Fantasy Flight for the characters.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="France">Lovecraft and cooperative games here ! I could not pass on that great combo : Cthulhu + coop !!! Rules are not that complex - wanted to rate them as "simple", I find the negative way to say it really better ! - and, as long as you're willing to live an adventure - a sort of light and sometimes incoherent rpg experience -, the immersion really works...  The replaybility is quite good with the different great old ones you can fight, but the number of encoutner cards is way too small. If you add the first expansion, Forsaken Lores, you'll have the game as it should be in his base version... That's why I give it 8 : love it but forces you to buy an expansion to complete it and give it diversity.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Poland">I was worried that Eldritch Horror will share the same flaws as its older brother Arkham and I was surprised to see that it's completely not true. I enjoyed the game a lot and we actually won in a fairly easy game, but it was no close call, so I believe that even with nastier cards in play we'd still have a fighting chance. A game which plays from 1 to 8 player and makes sense in not common, so even though I am not a giant fan of coops, I will play this again (and thus the high rating).</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United Kingdom">Far too long and slow with 6 players, 3 or 4 is the optimum and the game plays very well. Enough differences to make it feel considerably different to Arkham Horror, the linking of how clues are obtained with the story works nicely. Not quite as variable with a severe lack of cards in the base set but well worth having :)</comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Finland">2016-02-25 Concordia is an excellent game in which the key is to phase your own actions so that you are always one step ahead of other players' but in sync with yours.  The game revolves around constructive actions that all inevitably take the game closer to its finish. There are no negative actions, which creates an atmosphere that can be enjoyed by almost anyone. Player interaction is based on blocking, leeching and being the first to do something. And the game is very interactive, it just is not of the "In Your Face" type.   After the game you have a feeling that you actually accomplished something since, you can see everything you bought right in front of your eyes. And you can achieve quite a bit, which is refreshing after all the games with very tight economy. The dramatic arc has a nice curve and the game picks up some speed towards the end in an predictable manner.   I have to admit that the theme is rather generic and the game does not look exciting at all. If you can get past this, Concordia offers an enjoyable experience in hand and resource management. It is not a revolutionary game in any way, or a game that will be found in every home for that matter, but it simply works like a charm.</comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">An excellent game -- Mr. Gerdts has done it again!  This time his infamous rondel is found in how you play your hand of cards.  It's interesting how the cards drive the game.  You want to produce goods to sell and/or spend goods to get more cards to score more points but you need to keep with the produce/consume to do anything at all.  I want to learn more about the strategies with this game.  I'm still very much at a loss as to optimal paths.  But then so much depends on which cards you get and where the goods markers are on the map...  There's definitely a potential for the rating (currently an 8) to go up.  Probably tops out at a 9 for me.  Great game but not quite making my top 10 (so to speak).</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">1st play: Best new game in a long time. Tons of decisions, tight mechanics and fast playtime. The hand management is a smooth engine and I really like copying an opponent's action at just the right time.  2nd play: 2 player this time, the game plays quick, turns are fun and tense, lots of options to figure out and satisfying to play.</comment>

Very hard to tell who the winner is going to be unless you are carefully watching everything other players are doing and performing a lot of mental math which I like because it keeps everybody engaged the whole game.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Canada">The theme is definitely there, albeit not heavily; and the beautiful art certainly adds to the themeing. It just feels "Roman", whatever that means! But to say it's "dripping with theme" would, admittedly, be like saying the moon is covered with lush kelp forests.  As for Concordia being a deck-builder, it's far more of a deck-management game, and does that very well. Gone is Herr Gerdt's rondel, of which I am not at all a fan. Curiously, the playing of cards is remarkably similar to Lewis&amp;Clark; yet in spite of that, the two games are utterly different!  It is a strategic game with a strong chaser of tactics, that keeps the players on their toes and ensures a great deal of replayability. There is an element of multi-player solitaire in Concordia, but really, that's only because no one can attack you directly. Your opponents are actually very annoying, although that it is due almost exclusively to the "Hey! You took my spot/card!" phenomenon.   Negatives? Only two, really. Since you can't really see what kind of multiplier cards your opponents have, there can be an element of guess-work as to how they're doing. And by the way: if it is your first game, you simply MUST play it with the intermediate-scoring rule! That helps a lot, since it painfully reveals the reality of how scoring works in the game. Without it, you will be in for some nasty surprises at game-end. But, if each player has played Concordia at least once, there's really no need for it.  The second negative is that Concordia is just a smidgeon too long for what it offers you. Other than that, it is a wonderfully deep game with a mere four pages of rules!</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">Concordia isn't really all that complex or groundbreaking, but I find it to be a particularly pleasant Euro. I think it's neat that Gerdts managed to basically design another rondel game without a rondel. The card play gives you a nice sense of pacing with your actions.  The game is at its weakest when players pay very little  attention to what the others are doing. It's at its strongest when players pay attention to the VP goals others are going for and fight over getting relevant cards from the queue for screwage and VP gains.  Basically, the game is interesting when it's a struggle over competing VP goals with a little bit of "hate drafting" of what the other players want, and it's a bit boring if played as the dreaded "multiplayer solitaire." But it's easy to drift into the MP solitaire mode because of how intuitively the game invites you to just putz around building up your little economic industry on the board  w/o focusing on the VP battle. Plus, more players (it goes up to 5) adds more chaos and makes it more difficult to engage with what others are doing.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Spain">Uno de los juegos que m&#225;s me ha sorprendido en este a&#241;o 2014. Es elegant&#237;simo: s&#243;lo puedes hacer una cosa en tu turno: jugar una carta. Pero es que adem&#225;s s&#243;lo empiezas con 7. Parece mentira lo que puede dar de si un juego aparentemente tan simple como este. Menos es m&#225;s. Lo peor sin duda, la portada. A tener en cuenta que a dos las partidas pueden ser algo sosas porque no haya demasiada disputa. Para solucionar esto, venden un mapa mucho m&#225;s ajustado: Britania.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">Very good resource management/building/card collection game, where each player plays their own action cards, but you benefit from other players' actions if you play smartly.</comment>

Disadvantage: unless you keep a mental count, you don't know how well you are doing until the end!  Make sure you buy enough extra cards, they are multipliers and affect your score in an amazing way.  I played it with 3 but I think it would be better with four players, this should generate more interaction. </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="England">A grand scale game in every sense that is way, way too long for it ever to get the number of plays it deserves.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United Kingdom">The game that made me realise I enjoy reading rulebooks.   Bombastic space epic with a few tasty Euro influences carefully installed. Quite possibly ruined miniatures combat games for me (not that it took much). Not taken the plunge on my own copy due to the difficulty in finding a group &amp; day for it, but will happily accept an opportunity to play it.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">How do you design a game like this?  There are so many moving parts, decks of cards, tiles, bits, choices...  A very fun and interactive game, but a hell of a lot going on to keep track of.  Great theme, nice presentation, lots of strategy, and lots of fun.  Ameritrash gold.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Malaysia">The only reason I don't rate this higher is the time required to play this.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">Wow. The word "epic", while descriptive, is an understatement. This game has it all, especially with the expansion.   Only (nominal) downside: Long playtime... but bearable. Very bearable (for me, anyway... YMMV).</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">I *really* like this game, problem is due to the length it barely ever made it out to the table. Which was largely why I sold it.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="">Very intriguing game indeed. Only weakness is the game duration: 6-12h! Longer and better it is when there are lots of players (6-8) and all expansions!</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Malta">Epic game, includes almost everything one would want in a space game. Game length + preparation are downsides. Also requires a lot of table space. Won't hit the table very often, but when it does, it's a mind blowing game. Awesome.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Canada">Even though the objectives can feel disconcertingly out of place/theme, I am one of those players that can build a narrative out of TI3 and it helps that it has enough flash and chrome to assist in that. I truly feel like I am a space-faring alien race, out to bring glory to my people through combat, diplomacy, and treachery.   I can certainly see how some gamers may feel there is not enough meat and certainly too much downtime to keep engagement and the narrative flow.  I enjoy both the long term strategic planning and the tactical considerations each turn gives. You always need to be planning one phase ahead to do well.  Marred by a very long play time. Don't play this with easily distracted people or the AP prone because then the ratio* of decisions to time invested gets out of whack. But with the right group of people this can be the epic game you want it to be.   Another downside is that it can sometimes feel anti-climactic if Imperium Rex (game ends immediately card) comes out to soon. The uncertainty is part of the game though so it is hard to get too upset about it. One needs to prepare.  I find myself thinking about the game after it's over. I think about how my strategy did or did not work, my timing of the various play possibilities, and the other players moves. This is a good sign.  * Thanks to qwertymartin for the "ratio of decisions to time invested" concept.  </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">My favorite game when both expansions are included.  This fulfills so many wishes in a game that I don't know what could top it for an epic long game.  It has politics, combat, tech research, assymetric racial abilities, sc-fi, and much more on a grand scale.  The game is an event and I look forward to playing this more than any other game I own or otherwise.  </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">Epic good times.  Stories will be told...</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Brazil">It is a Space Opera, not a 4X like Space Empires, it is comparable to Eclipse in theme, but in mechanics it is very different. The playtime is very long, but the game is good enough to justify it. Like ameritrashes in general, there are events that can destroy the strategy of someone a lot, and this happened in the game I played after 7 hours playing and I didn't feel very good about this.  In general I enjoyed this game a lot, very beautiful miniatures, political and trade agreements present, the battle is the main focus, but not the only one. The thecnology tree is very good too, I like this a lot. The theme is great and very well implemented. A fine game but you need to be ready for political events that can be very agressives.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Germany">THE big game of galactic conquest. The gaming experience is VERY much dependent on the group you play with. Players who tend to ignore the logic of a game and instead ally with their best mate in order to then start bashing their other opponents can ruin the fun quite a bit. Games can last up to 9 hours but you'll usually know within the first 120 minutes whether you will enjoy the session or not.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United Kingdom">What a beast. The Euro answer to TI3? But not as long or complex. Yet at least as satisfying, though doesn't generate stories the way TI3 does. I like them both a lot but this is more my flavour. Like pistachio vs chocolate. or something.</comment>

I do!)</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Australia">Love Dominant Species, would have gotten a 9 if only it did not have the tendency to act as an extreme catalyst to people's AP.

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">Dominant Species is a war game with an animal theme on it.  The game is extremely deep and has a long play time of 3 hours (at least, depending on the AP of your group).  Because of this it's difficult to get it to the table.  It is a great game, and would probably not turn down a game (with the right group of people).  However, I might consider trading it away at some point because of how little it gets played.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Canada">Was fun but just too long. There is no reason for the game to go on so long. Having more species on the board doesn't allow you to do anything else other than score more points. Next time we play we will shorten the domination deck.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United Kingdom">Truly a game of 'survival'!  As the ice-age encroaches can your species adapt and migrate quickly enough to maximise the dwindling resources?  Perhaps a strategy of 'quiet attrition' over 'out &amp; out dominance' is key in the early part of the game with a view to 'rapid expansion' [particularly of the Tundra] at the 'end game'- avoids 'tall poppy' and maximises the shifting VP distribution.  More than enough variables and permutations to ensure a 'different' game each time.  The only [minor] criticism would be that there are too many 'Dominance' cards to choose from each turn - maybe 2 or 3 instead of five may accentuate their power but lesson the number of 'major events' per turn. [edit.] Having played it a few more times I think the Domination cards work well, also acting as a game length limit [when they're gone, the game is over] also for varying the 'end game' scenario, dependant on what crds [or combination of cards] are left. The domination cards also add one of the 'random' elements into the game - along with the 'element' re-seeding at the start of each round.  It has become more enjoyable with each playing.

Very, very good game!</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">I really like this game.  The theme, the asynchronus Animals, the impending ice age.  Great game, highly recommended.  -1 point for being very long.  It's not a detriment really, the game keeps you active, but it will be hard to get to the table at it's length.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Brazil">Played a few games on iPad and than I played a game in three with my wife and her causin, the real life play is a lot more fun and better, the game is tense and every action matters, the things you will try to do here is not letting the elements you adapt get depeled and make some very valuable actions, every action pawn have to count. The playtime is a little bit long, but sure in the end the game is worth.  Edit: played another time with 4, the game sure is better this way :D  My review in portuguese here: http://curitibaludica.com.br/2015/11/26/dominant-species-analise/</comment>

There are at least 3 lines of strategy here: collecting tiles for button income, collecting tiles for space coverage and managing your time on the track. It adds up to a highly engaging puzzle between opponents. The theme is beautifully rendered as well which only increases enjoyment. Lovely piece of work!</comment>
    <comment game="Patchwork" game_id="163412" location="Finland">Absolutely brilliant. I did not expect this from Uwe who I almost considered a lost designer of late. Lost to making games too convoluted and heavy.   Patchwork is a nice mix of planning a step or two ahead, blocking your opponent and seizing the opportunities. It offers trade-offs between getting the best tile for you and denying your opponent something. And again (like in Le Havre) your victory points are your resources.  Best of all, this plays in 20 minutes and still manages to be a satisfying experience.</comment>

    <comment game="Patchwork" game_id="163412" location="United States">This is a cool little game.  It's so easy to learn and play.  Every time I play, I want to try a different strategy.  The only draw back is how overly-balanced the game is, which might be a plus for many people. There is no way at all to get to an early lead.  Even if you do something really smart and get the right piece for the right price at the right time, you will still be opening up your opponent to gain something as well.  In fact, it kind of feels like one player could do almost nothing and it would still be a close game,  The counterbalance to this is how you construct your quilt board.  The one thing that matters more than anything else is fitting the fabric pieces well on your board.  This also means that very often it will be the person who gets the 7 bonus points for making a 7x7 grid who wins, but not necessarily.  Making a 7x7 grid costs you the opportunity to use larger pieces at the end of the game which are needed to cover large areas on your board.  Anyway, the games are ALWAYS close.  It doesn't matter how much "better" or "worse" you play, the game is going to be close.  There are too many balances in the scoring for one person to just slaughter another.  Nevertheless, this is a very fun very replayable game that can be found for a reasonable price.</comment>
    <comment game="Patchwork" game_id="163412" location="Belgium">Great 2-player game. Simple, fast playing. Due to the theme the game is great to look at. It makes you puzzle out your moves to create your patchwork blanket but try to stay ahead of the opponent. the 7x7 perfect blanket added bonus makes it competitive to finish your first. The different distributions of points at the end of the game will affect your game play.</comment>

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="Wales">It's a good game, and I'm enjoying playing it a lot, but some of the design choices are clunky: It is unintuitive to place dice results onto phase spaces where the symbols don't match (also to do the same thing when re-assigning dice); the hidden turns behind the screens are an odd feature - totally understand why they are there - but in a game with so much unintuitive stuff going on, this opens up a lot of scope for mistakes by new players going un-noticed; the gameplay is totally uninteractive.  That said, I love simultaneous play, and RFTG scores big on that point. The engine-building is very satisfying, the game length is just right, and the game seems well balanced. I like the aesthetics too.  My favourite genre is dice-rolling, and I have many such games, but this game doesn't feel like a dice game in any real sense. It has MANY dice included, but the rolling of the dice is of minimal importance in the overall gameplay (because dice can be placed on non-matching spaces etc.). There are few opportunities to re-roll dice, combine dice, add up results, push-your-luck: all staples of the dice genre. I have chosen to think of this as an engine-building game to sit alongside San Juan and others of that ilk. As a dice game it disappoints.  That all said, overall, it's a pretty nice package.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="Poland">2016-06-23 (rating 8):  I played only once and lost horribly but enjoyed the game a lot. This might be because of the dices - I love them.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">Fantastic game!  I wouldn't go so far as to call it a Race for the Galaxy killer, but my gaming group likes Roll better than Race because of Race's difficult iconography.  Roll is fast and fun with lots of strategy.  I prefer games like Roll with input randomness (i.e. the random element happens and then you make decisions on that out, rather than having a random element determine the outcome of your decisions), and the random factor in Roll makes for challenging decision making while also being something you can affect by choosing which dice you add to your civilization.</comment>

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="">+ Tactical Decisions You are constantly figuring out how to use your resources as efficiently as possible. It may feel like you are at the mercy of luck when you are rolling dice or drawing tiles, but there is almost always a way to turn things in your favor. Every round is a challenging puzzle that is rewarding to solve.    + Reading Other Players An important part of the game is being able to anticipate what other players will do so that you can take advantage of their phase selection. It is especially gratifying when you are able to pull this off.   + Satisfying Engine Building Building your empire by gaining dice from settlements and acquiring special abilities from developments is fun. There is always something to look forward to.  - Multiplayer Solitaire Because most of the game takes place behind the player screens, it is easy to focus on your own tableau and ignore the rest of the table. Even if you are paying attention, it is hard to keep track of what everyone is doing and what their special abilities are.

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">1st play: Wow, when I started hearing this game was good, I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype. After enjoying the Alien Orb expansion cards, and hating the orb, I was weary of this new twist to one of my old favorites. This game delivers, and might actually be a slight improvement over the original at higher player counts. I can't remember the last time my game-group buddies and I played a new game twice in one night(Aside from 15 minute social deduction games), but this one we did.  2nd play: Still excellent, the decisions to make each round are fun, the dice push you in one way or another, but you can still control your fate. I'm looking forward to the inevitable expansion at some point, but the game doesn't need it. This is an improvement over race in some ways, but not so much that it replaces it. Solid entry in the "for the galaxy" trilogy.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="Brazil">Great game, Tom Lehmann was able to create a completely different game using the same feeling of Race for the Galaxy. Don't think this is an easy game because it's a Dice Game, it is very though and interesting, very interesting design. I'm a huge fan of Race for the Galaxy and this one is very good, too.

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">Nice twist on a deck builder by swapping cards for dice.  Plays quick but still offers lots of tough decisions.  I like the mechanic of selecting which action you want to play after the dice are rolled while opponents do the same and only selected action dice are retained while the rest are sent back to the cup which adds a fun element of 'game theory'.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="Spain">Juego mucho m&#225;s sencillo que su hermano mayor "Race for the galaxy". Unos componentes brutales y un sistema de juego m&#225;s "accesible" hacen que este juego sea una opci&#243;n muy a tener en cuenta si aun no te atreves con el race.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">Played at Kublacon 2015.  Very nice re-implementation of the old RFTG using dice.  Lots of choice once again as you try to determine the path to victory.</comment>

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United Kingdom">Initial thoughts after just a few plays: The dice action selection works really well: it's a whole extra layer of tactical decision making every turn. It seems even more important than in Race to guess what other players will do, and it's easy to see from the dice on their build queues and production worlds what they might be up to. On the other hand, it is harder to see what other players' special powers are across the table because they are described in writing. That brings its own big advantage, though, in that there is less of a steep learning curve for newbies as there isn't the same (wonderful) iconography to learn. One generally sees far fewer tiles in this compared to the number of cards you see in Race: I wonder if that means it's harder to find synergies, or whether they are more dependent on the luck of the draw. Just a tentative thought, and I will enjoy finding out as I hope to play this game a lot.</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">kids really really love this game</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United Kingdom">Good fun, I prefer it to the card game. More mitigation possible with bad rolls and some aspect of trying to work out what your opponents will do so you can piggy back :)</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">Still hits the table regularly and gets better and better.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Decently-simple area-control game. The Spain setting is fun. The game plays smoothly and there is very little downtime.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Great area controll and influence building game. The grandfather to many new games but a grand old sire. Very enjoyable.</comment>

    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United Kingdom">ROCKY! </comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Poland">Probably the best territory control game. Very goof mechanism connected nicely with the subject of the game. The only weak point is that at least 4 players, ideally 5, are required for enjoyable game.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Excellent game. Simple and surprising. My only complaint is that it seems almost hard to fall too far behind. Maybe that's not a bad thing, though...</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Still one of the best pure area control games.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Canada">It's a 9 with 5 and a 7 with 3. One of the surprising things about this game is how simple it is to learn - pretty much gateway-game level. The depth, however, is so much more. It's a great, tense game... but also a bit of a min-maxing game which isn't my favourite style.</comment>

    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">This game will require more plays to truly appreciate, but I do just *love* the mechanisms in play. I needed a really great area control game and this one does indeed seem like the one. It's vicious, but that doesn't rattle me - sometimes, it's just the thing. Even though I have all the expansions bundled in this one box, I've never played with anything but the base game. Feels like enough for me. Classic.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Spain">Versi&#243;n Decennial con todas las cartas, expansiones incluidas en castellano :) Es un juegazo de mayor&#237;as por control de zonas, de los mejores. Apuestas por el orden de juego. Falta probar las expansiones. </comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Canada">One of the first area-control game and still one of the best. From my favorite designer too.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="China">I want to play this more! Now if I only could get four other people over at the same time...</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United Kingdom">Great game this. Very different to other games with some clever mechanics. Couple of cards feel a bit too powerful though (eg sending caballero's back to store).</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Netherlands">For over 20 years, this has been one of the best games out there. And it is easy to see why.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Canada">Really wish I could play that one more often.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">I very much enjoy 'area control' games and this is one of the best...</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Hans im Gluck German version</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Wow, I see why this is so highly rated! I do love area control, and this one has it, and does it right on so many levels! Can't wait to pull it out again!  Had a chance to play again, and I still love this one. Classic.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Italy">after few games,one of the best game in my collection!</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">So much going on here!  I have a feeling this game will age well with me.  Mmmm...wooden cubes majority...</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Sweden">Really solid area-control game. Probably the best I have played in the genre after Dominant Species and Small World. The mechanics with the king and the Castillo in this game really makes it feel unique though, and worth a place in my collection. </comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Canada">Fun game, I really liked the Castillo element and the flow of play. I look forward to playing again sometime.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Italy">Interesting cardgame, reminds (a lot) San Juan, but much deeper. Brain-consuming! The icon system is not user-friendly, in my opinion.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Italy">A role-selection model is used as a scaffolding to build your own - intergalactic - victory points engine, with plenty (an I mean PLENTY) of choices, all in a single deck of cards. The number of possible combinations and viable strategies is very high, with every card that adds a little twist to your progress through the game. You have to adapt your strategy to the cards you are dealt, with a new, different engine to tinker on during every play, an engine that keeps opening new paths at every turn.  The first impact on an inexperienced player can easily be overwhelming. The rules are clear and well designed (albeit a bit lacking in elegance, also due to the complexity of what the game is trying to portray), but the variety of ways by which different cards can interact with the basic rules and all the different icons used to describe those interactions need at least a couple of games to familiarize with. Then, another couple of games could help in making your gameplay fluent, so that you can finally begin to look at what the other players are doing, instead of trying to fit the last couple of cards in your masterplan. Even if a bit confusing, this learning process is usually really fun, even when you still don&#8217;t really understand the strategic implications of your choices.  A whole game can be really fast (usually under an hour even among inexperienced players), fast enough to easily lure for a second play after the first one and quite surprising in itself, considering the amount of gameplay and possibilities that are crammed in such a short amount of time. The fact that each player has his own deck of roles/strategies brings interaction between players near to zero. Sure, you have to guess the roles that are going to be selected by your fellow players and select your role in a way that maximize your advantage and minimize theirs, but it&#8217;s just another variable that you have to consider when planning your next turn.  Card quality is really good. Illustrations go from good to really good and the sci-fi theme is strong and well implemented. If you find all the icons and text on the cards to be a bit unfathomable do not worry, it&#8217;s much WORSE than it looks. Really, look at the player aid. I assure you it'll become of real aid after a couple of plays, but at first it seems as straightforward as an encyclopaedia in a foreign language. The iconography, to be fair, is actually really functional once you get it, but of course you have to get it first. The rulebook is well written and clear, no problems there.</comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Germany">Some gamers have become seriously addicted to this one. I'm not one of them, but I'd really like to crank out a few quick games of RftG with my husband again some time soon.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United Kingdom">Based on 1 play: Great game. Just like San Juan, but better theme and seemingly better executed. Can't wait to play again.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="England">This is a good game spoiled but spoiled by terrible card design (way too dark) and poor iconography. Notwithstanding that, I think I still prefer both Glory to Rome and San Juan</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">11-15-2014: I initially had this at a 6 after playing one game last summer. We played it again recently and it seemed to go much smoother, I guess since I had a much better handle on the rules. I'm not sure we would ever own this ourselves, but playing this with friends who know it well, it is an enjoyable, quick game.  DTC VFM</comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Germany">Played this one at Essen Spiel, bought it afterwards. Lots and lots of cards with special powers, so the game can get quite complex, but if one played trading card games before, you'll feel right at home here. I feel like I need to play more to develop more than the obvious strategies.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">Not nearly as daunting as all of the reviews and videos portray.  The iconography is intuitive, and easily explained.  The game flow is smooth and flowing and the game is not overly long.    Good game, will definitely play more.  Thinking it may go from good to great.</comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">Every time I play this game, I find a new strategy. This game feels like I just can't get enough of it and each time I'm dealt my first hand, I can see a new course of action to take immediately. The variable turn sequences add a lot of suspense and strategy to the game, and the space theme is fleshed out comfortably and intelligently.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">I've reduced my last rating since Dec. '08 from 9.8.  I still like this game, but I feel the game comes "full circle" with all 3 expansions.  {ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN + SIXTY SIX}</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Canada">I have a very conflicted relationship with this one. The theme is great, the graphics are great, even the game-play is pretty great... and yet, the game is presented in a very user-unfriendly way - in my view, this game could have been a solid ten if they had used fewer icons and more text to convey the game-play information. As it is, I am mostly playing against Keldon's AI (which is great, by the way).   Addendum: what's really great about the game are the many paths to victory - there are lots but you have to pick one and stick by it. Jacks of all trade will lose horribly. IMO, this is this game's unique selling point, most other games in the genre offer 2-3 and the rest is optimization... this game offers more, especially with the first expansions (more expansions make it bloated imo). </comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">This is a space/sci-fi themed card game that has aspects of 4X in it.  It has a somewhat high learning curve but once you are familiar with all of the rules and symbols, it plays fairly quickly.  There are so many different strategies to winning this game.  The base game is great by itself and each expansion adds more depth and replayability.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Poland">2016-06-23 (rating 8):  Great game. Although without expansions it seems to quickly start being to repetitive. Luckily there are many expansions there!</comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">A very good game.  Unfortunately this game is tough to get into.  I often play with new gamers and non-gamers, in which case this game is not well liked (but not hated either).  I would recommend this game for those who meet in regular groups with the same players.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United Kingdom">Rating based on 2 plays. Seems like a great follow-up to Dominion for those who have exhausted the potential of the original Dominion cards. For people like me who have only played the original game a couple of times I'd see little point owning both of them.  Edit:  I now own both of them!  But I have played the base game quite a lot now....</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">Second-best expansion, behind Prosperity. Comes with extra money and victory cards which is a big plus.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="Germany">A little bit better as the first edition, because you have more interaction</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">If you're about to take your first plunge into the Dominion pool, start with this one. A little more spice than in the original, for the same price.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">Solid expansion, adding more interaction without slowing the game too much</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">So far I love the player interaction of the Intrigue cards, compared to the solitude of the base game.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="Germany">see above.  This game can be played alone or with the base game (or other expansions).  Great addition&#180;as it holds even more cards to combine.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="Canada">Intrigue really flushes out all the nooks and crannies of vanilla Dominion.  I love the fact that there is much more variety to the games and that trying to get the provinces as quickly as possible is not necessarily going to win the game.  </comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">A meatier, more interactive game than the first one.  Moodier, more uneven, and more frustrating.  Any game that you can curse at and still come back for more ain't all bad.  This will be at least 1 point less than [b]Dominion[/b] because it would be more unfriendly to first-timers.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">The cards added in Intrigue put a twist on my favorite deckbuilder.  I like the multitype cards and how some cards utilize that well such as "Tribute" which makes the player to the left of the user discard the top 2 cards from his/her deck and rewards the user depending on how many different types of cards are discarded; an action card gives +2 actions, a treasure card +2$, and a victory card +2 cards.  The victory point cards with other uses also make the game more interesting.  This expansion adds quite a bit of fun variety and makes several new engines possible.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">This is a great little game for using with my students, outside of class, to build problem solving skills.  I like the asymmetrical thinking and problem solving the kids can do.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="Canada">Excellent card mechanics.  Great choices between "A" and "B" on many of the cards in this set.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">I was really stoked to try this game out at BGG.Con 2014 and after two plays ended up buying the last copy on the final day of the con. My wife may end up being the only one in our group who will play it with me, but it's a unique game in our collection and I'm happy to own it.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United Kingdom">Unexpected hit. Totally not my kind of game, but I *love* it.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Australia">Very mathy and analytical, it ends up being more fun that it has any right to be - the mancala elements and the djinn help a bunch with this, but ultimately the simple mechanics combine well enough to make a proper, fully fleshed out game with enough depth to satisfy most anyone, but without a particularly high barrier to entry.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Sweden">Simple rules but lots of choices. Great game! I think i prefer it with two.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Portugal">Great game. So much different paths/combinations to analyse! Tough not to AP... other players change our plans constantly!  I'm starting to feel that the set collection point system is a little unbalanced, at least for the 2P game...  </comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="">A good game, easy to learn.. but hard to master. High replayability.. a mancala with adrenalin lol</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">Mancala with Meeples on tiles. (I thought it was cool.)</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="">Quite a fun game with a great level of strategy. I started teaching my 5 year old the basics of it, but it will take him some time before it all comes together for him. The game can bring out some AP for those prone to it, but I love all the different ways to earn points.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">Amazing game. Easy to teach, hard to master. Very good replay value.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">I believe this game is great with 2 players. EVERY move you make matters, there have been several games where the ending score are less than 10 points apart. Even though the ending scores are as high as 200! I would rate it with 8, if just considering 2 players.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">The depth of strategy and balance of play styles in this game is a marvel to experience. What a great adaptation of the Mancala movement mechanism and variety of choices!</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">It is in fact very good. I was worried about the AP possibilities in this one - and it is overwhelming for a moment with all the meeples and tiles. But once explained, I think it's pretty approachable. The paths to victory are surprising. And the scores are generally very close. My second game was 141-139-139 and I don't think a one of us traveled down the same scoring path. It certainly was surprising. Gorgeous production, plenty of replay with Djinnis and my version (second printing?) replaced the offending 'slaves' with 'fakirs' - much appreciated for approachability makes for a great experience. Love it.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">I have only played once (with the expansion). I'm quite fond of the mechanics. I think I will like it even more as I play it more often. I played with a fast group, but I imagine this would be a slow game with my family, which would be my only critique.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Canada">I was actually concerned that this would be too much AP and when I played it... I wasn't proven wrong. But while there is a bit of AP involved, it's actually pretty fun. The mechanics are simple and there's tons of replayability.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">Another good game from Days of Wonder. Really no negatives...maybe the long set up. And the people bitching about slave cards, shut the fvck up. </comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - this game reinvents worker placement and meeples: the game begins with the meeples already in place &#8211; and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you displace these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure. It is an enchanting game, but the planning phase can take up a lot of time.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Canada">A new take on an old classic: mancala.  This game moves at a good pace, for being such a brain burner!</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Philippines">Set up takes quite a while, but the meatiness of the game more than makes up for it. Still a bit on the light side, but there are numerous, very definite strategies that could be taken to win the game. </comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Canada">OK, this one is entertaining and good-looking to boot. However, since this is a typical Euro, the theme is painfully pasted-on. Also, rules are totally arbitrary and don't follow any sort of thematic logic (you control tiles by emptying them?): this could have been a game about mice in a maze, collecting different sorts of cheese, or whatever. As for the look and the components, everything is gorgeous and nicely made, but I am a bit puzzled by the clash in the illustrations for the Djinns, which don't fit the rest of the game's look. My last rant is that setup is a bit complicated, and the game is definitely on the long side (it could be called "The Djinns of Analysis-Paralysis"). All that being said, all my criticism does not matter: this is a very good game, well-designed and fun to play, and I highly recommend it to everyone.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Spain">Uno de los mejores juegos del a&#241;o 2015. La mec&#225;nica principal es la ejecuci&#243;n de movimientos en el tablero (mancala) para llevarte puntos de muchas formas diferentes. Subastas y set collection son otras dos mec&#225;nicas presentes en el juego. A pesar de las subastas, el juego escala perfectamente incluso a dos jugadores. Un must have.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">This game is prone to AP, but the way to avoid that is to ask 'What do I want?' and find a place on the board that gives you that rather than ask 'What can I do?' and min/max every possible move.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Canada">Played twice with 3 players both times.  All players enjoyed the game, and the end score was somewhat surprising (and very close) in both instances. </comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United Kingdom">Better than the Wizkids versions, this is the consummate Star Wars gaming experience. The quality of the figures is exceptional, the organised play (should you choose to participate) is outstanding, but even just as a two player game out of the box it lives up to the hype.  Adding more ships enhances the experience, and the larger ships add new missions and augmentations that greatly add to the replay value. </comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United States">Get the soundtrack pumping, because you're going to be a dog-fighting super pilot. Early games may get hampered by some chin-rubbing and furrowed brows, but X-Wing is at its best when the action is fast and ships are careening around the table.  Once again Fantasy Flight takes a renowned franchise and strikes gold like a moisture farmer on Tatooine (shoehorned references are fun!). The size of the battles are up to the players, as is the amount of asymmetry, as ships move differently and have unique powers and pilots. The unpredictability ramps up the excitement, because players issue orders to their pilots secretly and simultaneously reveal them. It's not exactly a game of reaction, but a game of prediction.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United States">Such a fun game.  And so glad I've got friends who've bought all the stuff for this, thus saving my wallet.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United States">Simple, entertaining, and quick, with excellent production values. The business model is cash-grabby, but the game itself is quite fun.  You FEEL like you're in an X-Wing or TIE fighter, swooshing around in space, blasting your opponent. The components are excellent, the miniatures look BEAUTIFUL, the rules are simple, straightforward, well-explained, and well-realized, and the game just works! If you're a Star Wars fan, this is a definite buy.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United States">Fun and addictive to collect!  I just need to find someone to play with. Simple enough for Kelly, so I should be able to get this one to the table fairly frequently. </comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">Like Caylus, but fun. The theme is amusing when taken in the right light and I like the Intrigue cards. Great WP game.  4/30/16 - Jenny has gotten wicked good at this thanks to the iOS version. Still a blast to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Australia">My favourite worker placement game (I find Agricola too dull and Le Havre too strategically overwhelming, although arguably better it isn't for me, at least on iOS), Lords of Waterdeep uses fairly basic mechanics to create a stripped-down euro that encourages interaction and blocking without spite, and demonstrates decent replay value through quests and buildings.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Denmark">My first few plays of this was with 2, and I liked it alright. But it became rather stale, and I was debating on lowering the score to an alright #6.  But after having played my last 5-6 games with 4 or 5, it really have to stay at 8, or 8,5 if I could rate it that. It is so well put together and with the right group it is just plain fun and hectic to get the resources you want.  We have also used it to introduce some friends to the hobby, and 2 of them bought it on a whim, and are actually our main gamepartners now. The others also caught up on the game really quick, and enjoyed the sessions.  A great recommendation as a gateway euro, that might be a weenie bit heavier than Ticket to Ride and stuff like you normally consider a gateway game.</comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">The first Worker Placement game I've played. I really enjoy the gameplay, but the pasted-on Forgotten Realms theme adds an extra layer of enjoyment for me. It's a shame that the vast majority of the flavor text/lore for the buildings and agent factions can only be found in the manual. </comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United Kingdom">I really like this game. Its light enough for my non-gaming family members to enjoy but deep enough to satisfy hard core gamers too. </comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United Kingdom">Fantastic hour long game. All who have played, had a great time.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Great worker placement game with a D&amp;D theme kind of pasted on.  Your main resources are adventurer cubes which will just get referred to by there color for the most part. Although, the quests have interesting flavor text and art on them in keeping with the theme. Still a solid game, enjoyabletc still after many plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Very fast and streamlined worker-placement. I love that everyone "gets it" within two turns, and once you know the rules you never need to look at the rulebook again (there's basically no rules confusion or disputes). The theme is a bit tacked on, but the production quality is fantastic. You get a lot of game for your 75 minute investment.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Canada">Very fun worker placement game.  Strategy is pretty light, but the collecting and completing of the quests is very enjoyable.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Definitely add the expansion.  Lots of new quests and intrigue cards and options of places to go.  Really helps in those games with more than 3 people.</comment>

The expansions adds more variety to the game increasing replay value.  The game has been different every time we play it.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Germany">Lords of Waterdeep is a simple worker-placement game with a nice twist - named intrigues. Although the theme is just pasted onto the game and the mechanism is pretty simple (go there, take this) Lords of Waterdeep is actually quite fun to play. Not a game to play again and again and again, but worthwhile in between. Its refreshing nowadays to have a worker placement game that simple when other games of this genre try to beat each other with overly complex rules and options.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Canada">I like it. It's not that difficult, so it's pretty easy to teach and the number of choices isn't insanely huge like in some worker placements. There's a lot less blockage like some too, so that's also a plus. I got ganged up on by being issued so many mandatory quests, yet I somehow came up on top, so it's pretty balanced. I wish I could play it more though.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Canada">Good worker placement game, that can also be used as an introduction to worker placement, and that doesn't need knowledge of D&amp;D to play so anyone can pick it up. Bonus, if you enjoy the setting.  Great family game.   Fun and can be played in an hour (maybe a bit longer) with experienced folks.  Has surprising amount of tension as resources become scarce and well-played intrigue cards can hinder the best laid plans.  I like uncovering the various abilities of cards that can work together to create nice timing effects. A simple example: using a building to get a face-up quest and completing it in one turn when both spots at Cliffwatch Inn (which give the ability to take a quest card) have been taken.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">This is a fantastic game and really easy to teach as well.  I've had a lot of success introducing this to new people and I think it deserves a lot of the hype and attention it has received so far.</comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">I'm not sure if I enjoy this more than the pure board game journeys into the Lovecraft Mythos (Eldritch Horror, Arkham Horror, Elder Sign), but it certainly works as advertised with one of the smoothest app-driven systems released to date, and a very immersive, thematic style of play that will reward the patient who wish to dive in. Is it a little distracting to constantly refer to a screen in the middle of play? Sure, and this could very well have been a pure app or PC game, but the transition to co-op from the original Mansions of Madness seems to work well and I don't regret the asking price whatsoever.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Canada">Mythos Phase: You feel the darkness gasping your air, you take 3 facedown damage and 2 horrors. You are stunned ans dazed.... WHY???  Because the Ipad said so for no reason whatsoever and no chance to counter that. Yeah, sometime you can have a test to counter, but sometime you just eat it and keep going on. For sale!!!  2dn play: Much better this time. Maybe higher after several more play.  3rd Play: My initial impression of the gome is gone. This game is very good and better with fans of Cthullu. </comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Belgium">Provisional rating. I played first edition also and while it depended on the quality of the Keeper we had great fun with it. This time the Keeper is played by the computer, it works in a neutral way. If you had a bad set up of the game or an average game leader, first edition could suffer from that.  This is no longer the case for the second edition.  Solo play is good, but I think the game comes alive with more players as you discuss things and relive an adventure within a Mansion.  The main problem with the excellent first edition was that it didn't hit the table many times - once a year or so, while it hovered in my top 10 list still. Will it be different with the second edition ? Yes but MoM is a typical game you play 3-4 times a year, just like Eldritch Horror or Arkham Horror.   The story telling in these games is sooooo rich that any session stays on your mental hard disk much longer longer than your average board game, which is a great sign of a good story teller really.  Also the rating may go up a little or down a tiny bit as it is even more difficult to rate MoM towards the other Lovecraft games. It really depends on the mood setting as they are still quite different games. At the moment Eldritch Horror wins that battle with a few inches.  One last remark: since the program is available on 4 different platforms, there is absolutely no risk of software support in 5 or 10 years time. I still have my 1980's boardgames from Avalon Hill with assisted computer software and Windows is running these things on emulators better than it ever was.  EDIT. I upped the score to 8.4. Heavy stuff in time played. Even the simplest scenario took me 3+ hours.</comment>

    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United Kingdom">Based on 3 plays. The rules are pretty hard to get to grips with without someone who knows the game - just so much stuff to grasp.  But after 1 play I think we understand the game. Worth watching the rules video explanation if you are playing from scratch. http://www.mevio.com/shows/?sId=15871&amp;mId=6124298  And verdict:  loved it. Can't wait to play again!  After 3 plays still struggling with some of the fiddly bits of the rules. Starting to think that the game takes too long to play (4 hours last night). Downgraded from 9 to 8. I find it incredibly tense and traumatic being a human - which is great that a game can generate those feelings....</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="England">The core mechanics are ok, but nothing to write home about (probably worth a 6 out of 10). However, the presence of a Cylon(s) is what really makes this game shine. There is so much mistrust around and the Cylon players can really influence the game in their favour without necessarily revealing themselves. Great table banter although can be a little long</comment>

    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">This game can be incredibly punishing at times, but never loses its thematic feel. This should be the golden standard for licensed games, as you really feel, through the character powers/skill checks/locations/crisis cards, like you are on the Battlestar Galactica itself. From behind a facade of tactical combat, this game shows its true self: a bluffing/manipulation exercise. The real difficulty/beauty of this game isn't in blasting the most Cylons, but in deceiving the most players and hiding your true motives. That being said, the game suffers at 4 and, to a lesser degree, 6 players because of lack of balance for the Cylon players, but this is my go-to 5-player game.</comment>

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">1-27-15: I really enjoyed my first play of Arle.  Wow, there are a lot of choices!  The game is definitely challenging and stressful in the way that there aren't enough actions to get what you want done.  However, rating may go up or down depending on replayability, since there is very little randomness and very little blocking.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="Canada">An easy-breezy worker placement game continuing the theme of farming/agriculture well-established in previous Rosenberg games.  The game takes place over 9 rounds, signified by half-years/seasons, with each player having a set number of 4 workers and there being all of the actions available for each season right from the outset.  You have your own player board/principality as well as your own barn/garage for storage of your farming vehicles.  The actions consist of such things as plowing fields, cutting peat, obtaining animals, goods, building buildings etc.  Yes the usual suspects for the most part, although there are some differing and thematic actions such as upgrading tools and digging dikes and so on.  There really don't seem to be any bad options, simply a very good action vs a good action.  The "twist" is that 1 player can jump across to the other season to choose an action, but in doing so, blocks the other player from doing this and they also forfeit being start player for the next round (and it's always good to go first).  Nearly everything is worth points (which is the goal of the game), from clearing peat, to buildings (a major way to score), accumulating animals, collecting resources, vehicles, and travelling.  A very interesting feature is the vehicles; you can construct them and store them in your garage (space is limited) and each round you can load your vehicles with goods that then get automatically upgraded and you can travel to towns to gain food for goods as well as points.  Simple, intuitive and thematic.  The game is very peaceful and intuitive, particularly if you've played his previous designs.  It actually sounds very similar, but plays differently enough.  There is a harvest of sorts at the end of each round/season, but it's less stressful; you get some benefits, and your costs are fixed and a lot less than say in Agricola or Caverna.  Paying is not overly difficult to say the least.  This design is at least as thematic as any game Rosenberg's designed and it obviously plays great as a 2er, but there is my biggest issue with it- while I appreciate a great 2er as much as anyone, this is a very limiting player count (only 1-2 players), and as such it will limit it's opportunities to get played.    Has some variability with the buildings but a building expansion is obvious and perhaps even needed as there's not a lot of different buildings.  It would be nice to add at least the option for a third player, but it sounds like this is not going to happen.  Great components, great theme, easy smooth gameplay, enjoyable, but limited due to the player count.  Surprisingly different enough to warrant a purchase if you enjoy Agricola and Caverna.  Own the [boardgame=189137]Arler Erde: Advent Calendar promo[/boardgame].</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">An interesting take on the Rosenberg model: a game where virtually everything is plentiful. Food isn't particularly scarce, space isn't particularly at a premium, and it's pretty easy to get the resources you need (though it is slightly harder to upgrade them).   I liked the concept of pushing back the sea by extending dikes (even if doing so seems a bit too easy), and the tool mechanic is an interesting spin off of the normal resource accumulation as the rounds progress familiar to other Rosenbergs.   Rating on this one may improve with more plays and versus an opponent (as opposed to solo), as this certainly strikes me as a better fit for beating an opponent versus besting the game itself. </comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">1st play: Wow, what a gigantic sandbox. We had no idea what we were aiming for, but we each sort-of picked a goal and built toward it. I enjoyed this game, but there were a TON of moving parts. Gathering resources, trying to convert them to the right things, to build the buildings and vehicles I want. I really liked the vehicles, it made harvest time more interesting, and turned it into a mini-game all of it's own. The buildings are tough to build, but they seem to be the key to a high score. The spatial aspect of the board is not super important, but it does matter a little bit, and housing animals is very easy in this game.  2nd play: I enjoyed my play of this, but it's a VERY open sandbox, and it's easy to flounder a bit without some sort of direction. In Uwe's other games, there are certain objectives to go for, but in this one, there isn't much guidance. The result for some people can lead to AP, which isn't a problem for me. However, my primary Uwe partner gets bogged down in all the choices and makes me not quite as excited to play again. I do absolutely LOVE the vehicle and harvest mechanics in this game, and I hope he uses these mechanics again.</comment>

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United Kingdom">Very, very clever design. I love the travelling aspect and the conversion aspects. Lots of different options - and that is my only "complaint" in the sense that it is a game that needs to be played quite a few times to get over the initial shock of ALL THOSE ACTION SPACES!!! If I had a game playing partner, I suspect this would be a 10...</comment>

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="">As yet only played this solo - I have the german addition and whilst it is still very playable does need reference sheets which detracts mildly from the game.  Wonderful components and a great game here - just takes a bit of time to set up and put down.  Will get a lot more play once I get a game table set up.  Then after a number of plays I can give it a better review.  Love the range of interesting options to explore.</comment>

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="">Nov'15 May hit a 8.5 if I play and like it more in the future. Unfortunately, there isn't much replayability and it's rather expensive.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="Denmark">Really enjoyed my one play of this so far. It doesn't have the fierce competition or tension of Agricola, but it just might be my favourite Rosenberg to date anyway. Will need more plays to determine just how good it is.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="Bahrain">Loved the game. It's very frustrating and brain frying at first. Then you get acquainted with the different actions and moves.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">Initial Impressions: ---------------------- Much more interesting than I thought it would be.  Wasn't sure what else could be done with the farming theme, but this one works REALLY well.  While it was a little tough to form a strategy early, I think I got the hang of it about half way through the game.  One I very much would like to explore more going forward.  Probably a little too heavy to play with my wife, otherwise this would be a no brainer pick up.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">This beautifully crafted game is challenging and fun to play. I find it almost addictive, wanting to jump right into a second game after finishing the first to try a new strategy. The balance of actions feels pretty perfect and like most Uwe Rosenberg games, you can't do everything you want in your limited time, which keeps the game tight and engaging. You're always trying to optimize your move. Excellent game.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">I have no idea why I gave Dominion such a low score. Maybe because my introduction to deck builders was less than ideal. Others are better at certain elements, but overall, Dominion is where it's at. Upgrading from 7.5 to 8.5.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Germany">Crack in a box! Bought it in late 2008, before I joined the Geek. Otherwise there would be about 50 more games of this next to "Plays" as my husband and I spent entire weekends playing game after game of Dominion.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United Kingdom">Based on 1 play. I really enjoyed it and I had that "want to play again straight away" feeling.  It did seem a little like a solitaire game, but then I probably wasn't looking too closely at what my opponents were doing. And we were playing a game with only "Militia" as an interaction card. Looking forward to playing again.  Update: Played again.  Want to play some more!</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">The rating of 9 is for the Dominion family.  This is the game that turned me into a board game geek.  The Adventures expansion caused me to take a break from Dominion.  I will still play it, but am willing now to play other new games first to give them a try.  No longer am I wanting to spend an entire evening playing only Dominion.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">I have played this game three times now and like it more and more each time I play it. The fact that there are so many different sets of cards and you don't play with all of them each time makes for a very replayable game. Every time we have played we have tried a different combination of cards and each time it feels like it is a new game.   The game is very easy to learn too. I taught my 13 year old daughter in about five minutes and she beat me the first time she played. Of course I was giving her hints along the way, which helped her a lot. My fifteen year old son has beat me both times we have played. I highly recommend it!</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Father of the deck building genre, game has a tendency to devolve into strategic planning over tactical execution.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United Kingdom">So many combinations of cards, easy to learn, 2nd only to Race in the fun per minute category. Subtle interaction between the players via the attack cards. A satisfying game even after many, many plays when you start to see the delicacies of the system unravel.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Played this quite a bit on Goko - this game is quite fun! I think it plays best with 2 players, as more players actually shrink the strategy space (by giving you fewer turns to build a cool engine, thus shifting you toward more boring strategies that load up on VP faster).  The game is quite a bit more fun with all the expansions; I shamelessly just join games on Goko that already have them rather than actually buying it.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Canada">Great deck building game.  Simple base rules, with the strategy centering around determining the best card combinations that will lead to victory.  Family favourite, quick and fun to play.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Cool game of balancing ratios and engine building.  Can definitely drag with 4+ players, so keep the group small.  Expansions convolute this game and make it too top heavy for what it's supposed to be.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Germany">Great game! Very easy to explain and after 10 minutes everybody has the hang of it.   With the vast number of cards and combinations you can play the game with you really get something for your money.   Everybody who was introduced to the game liked it immediately.  Goal is to gather the most victory points. To archive thiss everyone buys action cards and other advantages to either annoy your opponents or to give yourself an edge. The cards are themed in the times of the knights and very thematic.</comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">[b]Includes Tuscany: Essential edition.[/b] [b]Includes the metal lira coins from the Tuscany expansion.[/b] [b]Includes the Moor Visitors expansion.[/b]  Worker placement games are a dime a dozen. I find most to not offer anything really new or game changing, and if the game lacks any semblance of a theme, I'm left asking why I'm playing the game in front of me instead of titles I already know and love.  And yet I was attracted to Viticulture based on ratings and the fact that it seems the theme is more than pasted on.  Update: One play with four players and I'm glad I picked this up. This is one of those games where the sum is greater than its parts. There's nothing really too crazy in the game that the typical gamer will not have seen elsewhere, but it flows very smooth and feels surprisingly thematic. Solid worker placement game. </comment>

WARNING: Those reports are heavy on spoilers.  So far, it feels like base game Pandemic, but even within the first game it began to feel like a different beast.  Just knowing that decisions you make in one game will have lasting repercussions changes the way you think about and play the game.  I'm looking forward to finding out what happens next!</comment>

However once the campaign was completed it was a breath of fresh air actually playing something different. </comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">Fantastic so far, through April. Take Pandemic, but add a chaperoned story. It's amazing and worth the hype.  Edit: Finished the game in 16 plays (plus one ghost play that we ended up resetting because I forgot to open a box). In the end, it was excellent and I am even thinking about playing again. The middle rounds (from June to October ish) are a little flat, with not much new coming out, but some of the twists in the final three months are amazing and were great moments. Reading the November mission briefing was an amazing "holy crap" moment. Excellent all around.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United Kingdom">Playing a campaign... early Jan lost, late Jan won, just about to start February. Really really enjoying it. A very good simple and quick co-op game that is ideal for the Legacy treatment: a magical gaming experience.</comment>
    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">This game was incredible. It was so massively addictive.  I'm glad we played 2p so that we could just keep going.  I loved uncovering the surprises!  What an experience.  A bit sad that it's over, though my BP isn't.  :)  And we won!  "Disaster averted!"</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">This is a great game, though I still don't understand why you can't draft military cards like you can civil. For a game where you have so much control, and military is so overpowered, the luck of the draw can really mess you up.  I've played this almost exclusively at BGO, so I'm not sure how high I would rank this if I had to play face to face and wait to play, which I can avoid with a turn-based online game.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="">Excellent game. Hours of fun. Best with 2 or 3 players. Highly recommend it!</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United Kingdom">Very keen to play this one some more, particularly with non-new players - rating will most likely go up but depends on my feel for whether the extra time investment is worth it</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Serbia">Masterpiece. One of the best game I've ever played. It has strategy, theme, interaction, lots of cards for replay value.  I haven't got a chance to play the original version of the game, but I wanted for a long time. Now I'm glad I did not, because this is an improved version of the game in every aspect.  Only downside is downtime, since every player has many actions during a turn. Also, long play time can be considered a downside - average 3 player game for us lasts around 4.5 to 5 hours - but when you have time to invest, that time invested is an upside to the game because of a very rewarding experience.  Update: average 3 player game now lasts only for about 2.5 to 3 hours tops, since now we all know what we are doing. With 4th player added, it can go to 5 hours easily. Great experience with 4, but huge time investment :)</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">Impressively designed game of sustainable growth with some hand management and a fun drafting mechanic.  What I like best is that you can accumulate points in a variety of ways without having the scoring devolve into a "points salad."  There's a victory track visible all game long, and you can plan accordingly.  Unlike a typical Rosenberg or Feld game, you aren't going to spend minutes tallying up points after the final round, and you aren't forced to diversify your approach in order to win.  It plays somewhat long, and the first few games might be awkward with a lot of down time as players take their turns, but this is fun and challenging game.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Poland">It's not a clean 10 just because of the expectations it set by comparison to the original title, otherwise a fine game which remains one of the best.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">This is an absolutely brilliant card-drafting engine-building game. There is a plethora of interesting tactical and strategic decisions. Everything has consequences and the game bombards you with tons of concrete information to make informed decisions. Randomness is limited and when it does exist, it is controlled (auction/drafting mechanic) and/or player driven (events). But what I love most about this game is it feels like your walking a tight-rope; you want to optimize your engine but you want to be able to respond to possible aggressions from the other players. Thus, the game is quite interactive and builds tension by forcing players to make tough decisions on how they should distribute their finite resources.   This latest edition changes the artwork, balances some cards, and makes some minor rules changes. Overall, it feels like a more polished version of the classical game. But I strongly recommend players purchase/play this version. Some of the minor rule changes (e.g. when military cards are discards) actually make a profound change in the game (e.g. reducing AP). And the rebalancing of warfare still keeps that element influential but prevents the 2-player game from being dominated by that element.   Brilliant game. Love it! I've played this game a dozen times and want to play it more.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Canada">Long game but doesn't feel long (time passes fast). Not to Heavy after playing 1st game (played without wars or agressions). It took about 3 1/2 hours for the first game and maybe 2h45 for the second one. My wife has a lot a analysis paralysis on top of that! But I'm confident that we can play a game under 2h30-2h once we know the cards. The game is AWESOME. Lot of tough decisions to make. What I like the most is that it's not a race like a lot of games. You feel you have time to develop you civilization with carefull planning. You don't have to do all in one turn. Like Tom Vasel said in his review, you want to do everything and there are a lot a good decisions you can make. So far, one of my top games!</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">After first play: Wow.  I knew I would like this game, and it didn't disappoint.  I loved the Civ computer games as a kid and this game scratches all of those itches.  It is so fun to see your civilization grow and the design of the player board is so smart.  Half way through the first play everything fell into place as far as managing your resources and food.  The only knock against this is the length, but it is worth it.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Vietnam">Such a well design, just a few rounds into the game I get sucked into it pretty hard.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Germany">I played two games of this edition and 14 games of the older one. This one improves the older edition and the older edition was a nine for me.  Downsides: It takes some time, but you can finish a 3 player game of Through the ages in a little bit less then 3 hours, if everyone knows the game and playes fast, but without rushing it. There is no catch-up mechanism, but in a game like this I don't want one. Its brutal, but hey its politics and empire building. Positive: Great engine builder. The engine has multiple aspects and you really can build it over a large amount of turns. The new card set is better balanced. The interaction is indirect, fair, but brutal (great). The amount of luck was reduced in the new version.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">Great Game. The only reason it does not get a 10 is that you need to set aside 2-3 sessions to play; our group is normally 5-6 people so conditions have to be just right for this terrific game. Playing for 6 - 8 hours or more is worth the time investment. Once you get the idea down as to relationships between food/resources/workers etc. you have a much better idea as to how and what cards you should go after. So many different strategies as to how to build your civilization that this has a lot of replay value. We may not get to play it often, but when we do, we will invest 8 hours and it will be a great deal of fun.</comment>

Need to download some player aids!  The only thing that stopped it getting a 10 was game length, unfinished after over 3 hours.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">Yes there is some luck involved in the die rolls, but the hand management and strategic elements of planning where to shore up your control far outweigh that (plus, the luck is largely done in thematic elements of uncertainty and I'm ok with that). One of the most tense games I've ever played, each card carries weight as to when to play it, where you opponent has, where they are trying to score, how they will crush you or lock you out of a region, etc. One of the few games where I really get into it (thematically) and like having a soundtrack on in the background (subtle, tense, classical strings), I just get absorbed into the game. It's a game where having an interest in the material is solidly helpful. One of the highest forms of praise I can offer is that it's a game that I just sit and think about in my spare time, and casually obsess about on occasion. It's a game that has refined (but not formed) my thinking in regards to many other game spaces; hand management, distraction, and risk management.  One thing that makes it over something like Matthews' 1960:MotP for me is that you now have much more granular movements and calculation of influence (instead of just the 4 regions, it's now regions with spots within them and your movement is restricted within the region based on prior influence placement). Second, I find the cards are much more circumstantial in their play compared to 1960 where it was much more cut and dry which cards I'd want to play for the event. In TS, it depends much more on what you want to accomplish since the board is much more granular and scoring comes around multiple times.  A bittersweet element of TS is that it's rules and design overall contain a number of sharp edge cases that ultimately have lead to a general plague of errata and clarifications (in similar ways to 1960, but many more in quantity). This makes it much more difficult for new players to learn how to plan and play properly, but does create some rather novel strategic and tactical plays, and is one of the reasons that I do just sort of sit and think about the game.  The greatest downsides are that new players don't understand the ebb and flow of the game (which makes sense as that comes with experience), it takes a while to play, and you have a ton of cards you have to learn (this part sort of blows). Second, scoring can be sort of convoluted to learn at first, and there are a number of times that doing anything outside of battleground spots just doesn't make sense which is unfortunate. Last; it's solidly not a game for everyone; some people don't like the card management of having 110+ cards to learn and understand the optimum placement and possibilities just to be competitive or at least solidly dig into the game (I dig that aspect, but I understand why others won't). All that said, I'll gladly play a game if I have the time and a willing opponent.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">The Cold War can get a reputation for being a pretty long and tedious affair, not quite as exhilarating as the explosions and flying bullets of WWII or the Civil War. Twilight Struggle captures the tension of the Cold War and displays the gravity of the situation in which we were living during that time, making it one of the most rewarding board games ever designed.  The gameplay is both smooth and effective, not simplifying the history, but instead bringing it alive through global domination and three different eras. Due to the design of the card play, you'll have cards that help your opponent, adding to the theme of having insider information via spy tactics or that your efforts will trigger consequences outside of your control.   A tight game that is more epic than you realize while playing it, Twilight Struggle is deservedly a modern classic</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">Thanks to the digital implementation I now have a way to try this game without having to find another live player locally.  This game absolutely deserves all of the praise it has received.  What's Great:  the DEFCON track--reducing it just enough to prevent enemy activities in certain critical areas, but not so much that you hurt your own long term designs or trigger a nuclear war; the hand management and position management puzzles to deal with all of those unfavorable opponent events you will almost certainly be dealt; the integration of the theme.  Why it Won't Get Played More (at least live):  It is certainly a game that requires equal skill at both positions, and an equal knowledge of the game (knowing what all of the cards/events in the deck do and when they are likely to appear), though in theory you could handicap one side by a set number of points to begin the game; Cold War theme, while I really like, is a turn off to many more 'casual' gamers.</comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">One of my favorites on the heavier strategy side of my shelf.  It's sort of like a combination of Puerto Rico, Settlers of Catan, and Small World, sprinkled liberally with pure genius.      The art design of the game is beautiful AND brilliant, making it relatively easy for new players to pick up--lots of visual cues on the player mats so that everyone is constantly reminded of how all of the various rules work and how they interact.  I like that all of the factions are not created equal--some certainly seem much easier to win with than others.  This allows for some balancing among players of different skill levels, which makes this game more enjoyable for newbies than Agricola, for example.  Lots of choices in this game which could lead to analysis paralysis, but not necessarily a game where a bad choice at an inopportune moment seems to cripple you as much as other games.   Update:  Can't wait to see the digital implementation for this and excited for the additional opportunities it will provide to play this.   </comment>

AND it's a ton of fun. Played with 4. I can see this as having huge replay-ability. Downside - I don't own it (and would likely have huge difficulties getting this one to the table with friends/family). I can't imagine this as good at 2 players.

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United States">Such an interesting one!  The varied player powers and costs, along with the round chit thingies, vary the game nicely.  In addition, those competing desires to be next to others and yet not have them snap up your real estate.  I want to play this more.  6/05/13:  Upgraded to a 9.  LOVE THIS ONE!  Repeated plays bear out the awesomeness.  The 14 factions are cool, but it's the variability in the round bonuses and the turn tiles (whatever they're called) that make this worth playing again and again.  Plus (almost) everyone I introduce it to has enjoyed it.  One guy is lukewarm.  Very well done!  By the way, negatives (aka reasons this isn't a 10 for me):  (1) Game length.  This takes a long time to play though I think it's worth the effort/time.  (2) Lack of speed for player turns.  What other players do can influence what you do, thus making advance planning of your turn difficult at times.  This slows down play and is mildly unavoidable.  (3) The screwage is distinctly annoying.  Where does it occur?  Snapping up power actions and real estate, outflanking on the religion tracks, and in the number of cities.  I *really* dislike the limited number of cities in a 5-player game.  With 4 players, it's very unlikely to be an issue or ever come up.  With 5 players, it's unavoidable and devastating.  You can't wait on forming your cities and, if someone beats you by getting their 3rd (which I've seen happen), you may be out of the game.  Which stinks.  Notwithstanding these, a truly excellent game!</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes and each group is bound to its own home environment so to develop and grow they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups. Terra Mystica is a game with very little luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that each group has special skills and abilities. Taking turns the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. It is the ultimate eurogame for me at least.</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - an epic space battle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. As in the video game it is based on, the Empire has to find the secret rebel base, while the Rebels have to gain loyalty in order to outlast the Empire's schemes. In the game you'll take your leaders and send them on mission to gain support, to build, even to fire the mighty Death Star, and also to move your fleets between systems and combat the enemy. The game is all about hard decisions, and card management. The combat is straightforward: the winner takes it all. Up until the last moment, everything is tensed. But, it can take up to three hours and that can be a hindering fact.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">Long time to play, long time to setup yet despite this an amazing 1 on 1 game play where each side feels completely different. </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United Kingdom">The best two player game on the market. I prefer this to twilight struggle or 1775 due to the amazing theme.

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Canada">Fantastic asymmetrical game that really captures some of the cinematic feel of the franchise and the overwhelming feeling of the Empire trying to hunt down the Rebellion. The game can start to feel long as it goes on but doesn't really diminish the enjoyment too much.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Kinda shocked to say, FFG game with a hot license that wasn't mailed in at all. I only played it once, but WoTR totally didn't do it for me. This is similar in the light versus dark, hiding versus searching aspect, but I think they got it way right. After a few more plays, bumping from an 8 to a 9. It's wonky, it's swingy, but steeped in narrative and never overstays its welcome. Love it so far.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">LIKE:  - looks and feels epic - excellent component quality - asymmetrical sides, offering a different experience - recruiting and using leaders - wide variety of missions and objectives - lots of close calls make for tense and fun games - despite the sheer size and power of the Empire, the Rebels have lots of fun tricks up their sleeves - each game delivers memorable moments - lots of Star Wars flavor  DISLIKES:  - combat is a little lackluster - randomized starting positions can put the Rebels even further behind the 8-ball right from the beginning of the game - the rule book does not address certain intricacies</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Where to start that hasn't already been said?  This game is War of the Ring for the Star Wars universe. It captures the FEEL of the original trilogy very well. There's some great bluffing, great push-your-luck mechanics and a wonderful cat-and-mouse game between the Empire and Alliance.  It's one of those games that if you were to play 100 games of it with the same person, individual strategies would arise between the two of you - expected bases, methods of lockdown from the imperials, and ways to counter those strategies.  However, due to the length of the game, I don't think anyone will ever saturate the iterations needed to know the game that well.  A big complaint a lot of people have is the combat. However, I don't see it as too bad - it doesn't take long, and is easy enough to learn. It can be a bit of a dice-fest, but that isn't too much of a problem because it isn't central to the game.  Can't wait to play this one more.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Star wars Episodes IV-VI in a box. Dripping with theme, if you are the rebels you are vastly outnumbered and outgunned. If you are the Empire the Rebels could be anywhere and every victory of theirs makes it tougher and your victories might not change anything.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Belgium">What a game. Great components. Deep strategic game with immersive gameplay. Negative is it's length and price (but it's not expensive if you look at the components).</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">This is the THE game for Star Wars fans.  It is a panic attack in a box...   It can be uber intense...  but plays out EXACTLY like you think it would/should.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Romania">This is the kind of game that you talk about for hours ( or days ) after you played it. So much story and so much theme that you can basically rewrite Star Wars. And a lot of tension for both sides.  Playing as the dark side, I ended up capturing Luke Skywalker with Boba Fett, then corrupting him with Emperor Palpatine and then I made him to fight Obi-Wan Kenobi.   The only downside of this game is its length.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Beautiful design.  Played it with 4 players and it was very fun.  Won as Rebels, but was a card draw away from losing halfway through the game.  Long but worth the experience.  Played it a few more times and like it more each time.  All my games have come down to the last turn and a couple of die rolls in the last turn determining the winner.  I think this has been well playtested and seems very balanced to me.  A big time commitment, but can't wait to play it again.  This is a great experience with tales to tell win or lose.  Highly recommend this game.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Love this game.  Super thematic and it just makes you feel like your right there in the movie.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Captures the feel of the movies into a very rewarding game. In my opinion, length is perfect for a game that is supposed to span 3 movies. My only gripe is that battles are a bit fiddly. Tactics cards are ok. I really wish leaders would provide a more thematic impact on battle rather then just drawing battle modifying cards. Aside from this gripe, this is a fantastic game. Thematic, cinematic, and memorable. </comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United Kingdom">Need to play with varying player counts to be sure, but this may be my new favourite game...</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">Great game, surprisingly quick to learn considering how complicated it seemed at the outset. The mechanics are rich and intuitive. Played with my friend who has a collector's edition.  I am jealous.  All 4 players enjoyed the experience and the end was close enough to come down to a tiebreaker.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">Excellent game.  Really enjoy it.  I play it a bit more tactically than strategically after less than 10 plays, but expect to "graduate" soon as I learn the different capabilities of the factions and player boards.  Looks more daunting than it is.  Rules fairly simple to remember and implement.  Your choices are a delicate balance. To me, it lives up to the hype.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Japan">It's a game that can easily accessed and appeals to a wide variety of people. I always enjoy seeing different strategies unfold and discussing them after were finished. Also, the art and components are amazing. Always a pleasure busting it out.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Scotland">Awesome concept stunningly executed</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">I got to playtest this game as part of the massive blind playtest. I saw it evolve through several iterations, all the way to its [nearly] final state. I love: the artwork, the asymmetrical player mats, the "upgrade" part of the engine-building, the realistics resources, the metal coins, the Euro-style problem-solving coupled with the threat of Ameritrash territory fight. The actual combat system isn't my favorite, but even after playing more than a dozen games, I can't think of a better way to incorporate head-to-head conflict over territory into a eurogame, so I guess it's actually as good as can be expected. The number of player mat - faction mat combinations make replay possibilities very large, as does the game's flexibility with number of players. I've played with every possible player number and they're all good (another thing that increases the replayability is that the game plays differently with different player counts).</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="">Literally the best game I have ever played. Incredible mechanics and introduction of combat to a Euro-Style games.   Resource management, worker placement, area control, combat enabled, unique as hell.  Needs an easier way to manage the board, basic board is too small for 4 and 5 players.</comment>

The quality of the components, the gorgeous artwork, the beautiful board.    Game play was great - a neat combination of euro mechanics with tactical board positioning, resource management and (at least the ever present threat of) combat.  The tension between players stands out on multiple fronts: the tactical game play, the race for the factory, and the race for six stars.  I love the asymmetry and you think twice about engaging in combat - especially with workers present on the other side.    I think this game will stand the test of time in our household.  Love it!</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Germany">I may well end up getting rid of Agricola in favour of this, seeing as I never enjoy playing Agricola with the cards anyway (too random for my taste) and the adventure mechanic is a really fun addition to the system.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">I may like this more than Agricola because at the end of the game, there is a feeling of abundance rather than disappointment.  In agricola, I can win the game and feel sad that I didn't create a good enough farm.  Time will tell though.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="">My favorite the game at the moment, but the time it takes to play is limiting the number of plays I can get in.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United Kingdom">For a while I preferred it to Agricola, but I think long term Agricola is the better game - this is however a lot less stressful!</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Denmark">GREAT game, and very, very well put together. Awesome components. But there is so many pieces and setup and takedown is what keeps it on the shelf. Such a shame, I really like everything else about it.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Austria">+ Mini Expansion.  Caverna is... amazing! For my first three years into the hobby, this has been my favorite game, as it has all the qualities I find enjoyable in a game. It has an excellent strategic depth with many many paths to victory and it's extremely challenging, since you have to manage so much in such a short time. For the 20+ plays this game overwhelms you with all the options and possibilities that offers, giving you a huge deal of re-playability. I have so much fun with this game, that I don't even realize the time running.  I find almost pointless to talk about the components of the game. I've never seen anything like this... just amazing! Yet what really makes this game shine for me is the fact that, when you're finished playing it, you can look at your board and see what you built. Your animals, your mines, your rooms: it's just too cool!  After 50+ I've to say that I'm sadly a little burned out of this game. Now that I've explored every strategy multiple times, I find myself wishing to see something new coming out for this game. I want a nice expansion with lots of new room tiles, that could bring back the feeling of an incredible amount of options that the game gave me in the first place. Until then I'm forced to lower my rating a little... and I can't say anymore that this is my favorite game.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Canada">So many options!  :)  This game is rich with theme and mechanics.  I really enjoy it.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Definitely seems like there are more viable early game paths in this than in Agricola.  Rather than just an urgent need to grow your family in order to be competitive, you can viably start farming or start breeding animals much earlier on, as well as mining and adventuring.  I really like how adventuring rewards a small family size by forcing you to play your higher level character last.  If you want to be able to play it before other players adventurers, you need to have less people than them.  This gives a few reasons why you wouldnt just go all in on family growth.  Additionally, the harvests come fast and furious, so you really need to develop an early food engine.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Canada">Perhaps a higher rating them some have given it, but I like it as much as Agricola or more. So I had to rate it the same! So many pieces makes set up and tear down long. But the quality of the bits are great, and their quantity allows for up to 7 from the get go (and lots of options) which adds to this game. No there are no cards, but that is a selling feature for my wife, and I think there is plenty of replayability without them. The fact that the feeding takes place more often but is less stressful then it's counterpart also speaks to how masterful a remake this game is.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Finland">Oh my. This is so going to replace Agricola.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">Not as tense as agricola, and doesn't quite carry the sublime feeling the former game has of pulling everything together just at the right time, nor does it have a card draft which really elevates the 'gric into gamer nirvana. But it is highly entertaining, and much more accessible for non gamers. My non gamer gf loves it (and loathes agricola) and though the box can be as intimidating as hell, the rules are VERY well written. It doesn't take that long to play, the components are fantastic, and it gives a very satisfying sense of creation (more so than even agricola) as you watch your farm/cave take three dimensional shape in front of you. The price point is the only thing keeping me from recommending this wholeheartedly to everyone.  Played multiple times solo as part of the 2015 10x10. Not as good as agricola solo because it lacks the legacy element of keeping an occupation and building on your previous score, but still good fun and enough options to keep things interesting.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Norway">This game and Agricola are very similar. I like Caverna a little bit better so far. The game is really good.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Germany">Yeah! Much better than Agricola, like worker placement, like the possibilities. Like that it's not as punishing as other games (looking at you Agricola). One of my favorites!</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Sweden">Great euro game. The design of the game is outstanding. I never played Agricola, but I believe that this is more up my alley.  The expeditions are fun, there's different strategies that offer really good results.  It does not play as well at the higher player counts, 6-7, but this was probably obvious to most people already.  The only issue is repetitive gameplay. Even with the different strategies applied each time after several close plays it feels a bit repetitive, but that is probably more of a flaw of the whole genre and not of this game in particular.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="">I definitely enjoy Caverna much more than Agricola because I don't feel like I'm constantly struggling to break even throughout the whole game. The adventuring mechanic is really fun, and the game feels more like development and forward progress than disaster management. Although there is competition for adventuring spaces, there are multiple valid strategies for winning, which, to me, makes it a great game</comment>

Bello anche il poter interagire,anche se in modo abbastanza indiretto, vendendo la carta che davvero serviva al tuo avversario. Sarebbe stato bello se ci fossero pi&#249; meraviglie che ti permettessero di scartare le carte avversarie.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="United States">My wife and I love to play 2 player strategy games.  Many times a week, we will sit down to play.  Since we bought this game about 3 months ago, it has become the first thing we grab.  We have had to print off more scoring sheets (we keep track of every game).  I don't think we've ever played less than 3 times in a sitting.  Every game is different.  We are always trying new things to develop new strategies.  And what is crazy is that we always have these moments when the cards are just not being revealed in our favor, and one of of is getting irate, yet we are still able to pull off a victory.  The 3 different methods of winning are key to the replayability of this game.  All you have to do is pretend to be going for a military or science victory to get your opponent nervous.  If they don't get nervous and change up the play-style, keep going, you might actually secure a military or science victory.  If you wait too long to take  a military victory seriously, it can become your sole purpose to keep military cards out of the other person's hand.  That frees up the other person to just rack up the additional points.  There are also lots of sneaky ways to accomplish your goals.  The only problem I have with it is that it is not possible to gain a science token on the 1st age, but at least half of the science tokens are really only useful if your get them early.  There might be creative ways of using them, but many of them NEVER get bought because they are NEVER useful by the time they are available.  I wish the science cards were more randomized throughout the game. Also, you might go for science early, not knowing if there will even be a possible science victory in the third age, with the way the cards are randomized.  It would be nice to know that there is at lease some way to gain a science victory in every game.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Australia">Haven't ever played regular 7 wonders, bought this from our local games store on their recommendation... love it! Very different and great 2 player game</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="Canada">Great 2 player version of 7 Wonders.  New mechanics are interesting and work great with 2 players. Game is a lot more confrontational than 7 Wonders though; everything you do affects your opponents, and vice versa.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders Duel" game_id="173346" location="England">I love the fact that there are three ways to win the game.   I like the art design, but would have preferred slightly larger cards.   We can play a game in 20-30 minutes quite easily.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">It seems overwhelming at first, but it's really not that hard of a game to understand.  Even though you have to read and reread the buildings to determine how they are used in the game, I give Puerto Rico  a "ten". </comment>

I had avoided this for a while fearing that it would lean towards the person with the most experience. But now after playing 30 or so games, this is well deserved rated so high on the BBG. Absolutely fantastic game!</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Netherlands">One of the best games I own.  I like the part that you play 'alone', you make your own decisions and there is only so much luck involved.</comment>

    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">Only one play thus far, but really enjoyed it, and can already tell it's a well-balanced game with many different paths to victory.  Giving it a "9" for now, and we'll see how it holds up after multiple plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">I wanted to dislike this one, since all I ever hear/read about it is how great it is (except on the Dice Tower).  But after playing it, I have to say this game is great.  So many options!</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="United States">One of the best. I like how there are several paths to victory in this game, and choosing roles each round is a great mechanic. The official two-player variant from Alea also plays very well.</comment>
    <comment game="Puerto Rico" game_id="3076" location="Finland">A true classic. Eventually, after dozens of plays it gets a bit dry, and flashier games have come along during the years, but it's still an elegant and entertaining, great game. </comment>

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Canada">I would describe this as a Feld gateway. If you haven't played a Feld before and want to get an idea of what his games are like, you should play this game. Loads of ways to score points, easy to learn but has lots of decisions to make. This is probably my second favorite Feld game I have played.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United Kingdom">Up until Castles I mostly just played thematic games - this won me over!</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United Kingdom">A ton of game for the money. Components and theme leave a lot to be desired, but the mechanics shine through. Won my fiancee over, who normally can't get past a lack of theme. Possibly my favourite 2p game, cries out for a deluxe edition.  I also like the way it scales. Very relaxing at 2p, tense and busy at 3p, not tried 4p but guessing it's even tougher.  Update: As much as I personally enjoy the game I'm quite surprised it's climbed into the top 10. My guess would be that the core 'dice = actions' and tile placement mechanics are so satisfying that it keeps players engaged long enough to get past the initially fiddly array of building types and knowledge tiles.  </comment>

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Spain">Juegazo Eurogame! Otro gran Feld. Sin cartas, con dados, pero la suerte la "planificas". Es un juego de estrategia de construccion de zonas muy especial y logrado. De 2 a 4. Funciona perfecto, m&#225;s r&#225;pido, con 2 o 3 jugadores. A 4 m&#225;s pique indirecto, pero m&#225;s largo y hay demasiado AP. Tienes que tener en cuenta muchas cosas y gusta mucho la toma constante de decisiones. Por contra, comentar que el factor suerte, tras varias partidas, se aprecia demasiado elevado para la media de los euros. Imprescindible las expansiones de tableros nuevos para el juego: la nueva regla de construcci&#243;n en &#233;stos, le a&#241;ade un punto de mayor dificultad al juego. Se puede imprimir el tablero que Feld dise&#241;&#243; para el torneo de 2013.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Finland">What a brilliant game. Clever use of dice feels always refreshing and helps in avoiding the pitfalls of over-analysing. Burgundy successfully combines two mechanics I like, tile laying and dice, into a streamlined set collecting. Sure luck plays a role but good players can turn apparently bad throws into their own advantage.    Minor negatives are the dull art and the bad use of symbols. The meaning of some symbols is rather hard to understand just by looking at them. You'll need the manual. </comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">Excelling dice rolling/tile laying game with tons of strategy and options available. This is the kind of game that will keep pulling me in for more and more.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">This is my kind of dice game.  Not only does the game allow for luck mitigation through the use of workers that can add or subtract from your dice, but rolling higher is in no way more beneficial than rolling lower.  The only difference between die results is what you can do with the die.</comment>

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">This game has nothing to do with Ron Burgundy. It is, however, easily one of Stefan Feld's more well known games. Castles of Burgundy is a game about building your territory on your player tableu one drafted hexagonal chit at a time. You roll dice to determine what chits you are allowed to draft and where you are allowed to place them. Territories within your tableu can represent specific sets with powers that you can leverage to better score points. The theme and art are pedestrian unless you are a fan of pastoral landscapes and farm animals but the game design and play more than make up for it. One small gripe is that the game needs a insert or a Plano box or something that helps you keep all the chits sorted or you will spend a lot of time sorting each time you set up the game. </comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Spain">The best game of Stefan Feld by far, IMHO.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">A Feld game that even my non-gaming wife can get into (probably because of the farm animals!).  Lots of fun and strategic with the die rolls.   6/2015 - Game continues to be a hit and is getting more and more of an audience.  Kelly still requests this periodically and Mike gave it a try at the VP open to good success. </comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">Great dice/worker placement game. So many decisions.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">Love this game. Really need to expand my Feld collection.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Canada">Rich with choices and paths to victory. Badly needs a special edition with better boards and better looking pieces though: as it stands right now it appears overwhelming for casual players.</comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="Netherlands">A great gaming experience where everything fits together and you are left planning move after move and pulling out extra bits and pieces all the time. Not super interactive but it doesn't matter.  When playing with less than 4 one tip is to allocate all tiles that will be needed in the game (randomly) and then turn up the others so that people can see which tiles will never come up. </comment>
    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United States">Wonderful game!  I love how the dice-rolling complements the gameflow and available strategies.  Bad rolls can be bad, but you can power through.  Very well done!</comment>

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="">I have been playing this solo for the most part, and after about 10 solo games, I have decided that I only want to play this with other people. The cards don't offer enough variety to significantly change the game for me.  It has become boring and repetitive.  I am glad my husband is slowly beginning to like this game better (after he won a couple of games).  Introducing the complex cards was a good idea.  Even my 6 y.o. didn't feel that the easy deck really added to the game, but the complex deck does begin to make things interesting. </comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Italy">My favorite game ever! Many friends of mine say they prefer to play it without cards. In my opinion, cards make it richer, thougher and more variable. I think I'll never stop playing it.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United Kingdom">This game instantly became one of my favourite boardgames of all time the first time I played it - and has continued to get better and better.  I found the instructions extremely complicated, considering the game is actually very easy to play. It is very challenging and has great depth, whilst remaining fairly simple.  Definately recommended.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">I remember the first time I played this my brain was overwhelmed, I had no idea what was going on, and came in last place. As in, very last place.  But after a few plays it really grew on me. This is one of my very favorite games, and by far my favorite "Euro" worker placement.  UPDATE 8-15-14: Bumped down a bit to an 8.5. It is still one of my favorites, but it just does not hit the table as much as it used to as we have so many other games that we would rather play.  UPDATED 10-10-14: Played it again recently and bumped it up to a 9. What can I say, I still really like it.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">After 6 plays it's one of my top 5 games.  With a couple of wins it's even better.

However military deck is a bit too random.  2010-04-17 (rating 8.5):  A very interesting game. Differs much from the computer Civilization but is in no way a drawback for me. While playing one has to constantly decide what to do now, what to achieve next, how to adapt to what happens. And the resources of all kinds are always in shortage. Many ways to victory including the military one.  But I still haven't played it with more then 2 players. Lets hope I will have a chance to try.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Finland">To anyone reading this, heed my advice: Make sure you have no other appointments the same day, bring a lunch box along, turn off your cell phone and enjoy the game.  I like this a lot. A long but rewarding game that keeps you in its grip. At the first play you can't have a decent strategy (don't even try to have one), because there are just too many cards to learn. But you'll do better next time, when you know what to aim at.   There is a constant shortage of resources which forces players to make important decisions all the time. You cannot accomplish everything and hence you need a strategy. It is really rewarding to see your plan come into reality. The balance between longer term strategic and short term tactical decisions is spot on.  A few of things to whine about:  First one is the fiddliness. The pieces are ridiculously small for anyone to handle comfortably.   The second one is the counter intuitive corruption mechanism. It is an integral part of the game and it has to be there. However, now a big part of your game is actually about managing those blue production tokens so that you have precisely the number that does not trigger higher corruption. This forces you to focus on big productivity leaps instead of grinding your way there gradually. Yes, it is the nature of the game, but in my opinion it takes too much energy in a game that should not be about micromanaging.   The third one is about the game length with four. Ideally more players should introduce more interaction and thus add to the excitement. This might happen but at the same time downtime increases drastically, and so does the game length.   Verdict: Absolutely one of the best games, but only with three players. In the end, I decided to sell the game. This just never hits the table because "it's too heavy", "I have to take the dog for a walk", "I have to blahh blahh". You get the point. TtA is a total pain to teach as well. Hence, as a part of the process of ridding me of unnecessary fire load TtA had to find a new caring home. I am going to miss you baby. Hope to see you sometime.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Wow.  Just a great, [i]great[/i] civ game.  I really enjoyed playing this one and I'm definitely looking to pick it up when the next print run comes out.  The random element is in the card draw.  Works very well, though, since the cards are separated into five ages.  The card powers and strength directly correlate with the advancement of the game (the current age), providing an excellent development mechanism.  I also like using the cards as the clock.  Takes a while to play, but entirely worth it.  For game length alone, I do not recommend playing with 4 players unless they're all experienced with the game.  The 3-player (2 newbs, 1 teacher) learning game I played took around 6-7 hours.  The 4-player (3 experienced &amp; me) took about 5 hours.  Like I say above, 4-player isn't horrible if the players are experienced and really try to keep it moving.  Rated a 9 instead of 10 simply because game length, and length of a teaching game (which can be considerable), will often preclude plays for me.  Yes, that's largely due to the wonderfully implemented complexity, but it's enough for me to drop my rating a notch.  If there were a way to bring it out more often and get more plays in, it would rate a 10.  And yes, I know there's the shorter beginner game, but I really enjoy the complexity and choices of the longer non-beginner (advanced?) game.  The duration isn't a minus for the game itself per se, I'm more annoyed that the game length will prevent me from getting many plays in.  If you have any interest in deep games that enable long-term strategies with *tons* of choices, try this one.  You won't be disappointed (unless you are).</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Germany">From the description I expected a dull game. While it is not perfect, its many options and the satisfying experience of building up a civilization in ~4 hours earn it a high rating.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United States">Long length is a drawback, but its very good.  I learned it at midnight, played again after finishing (to 7am!!) and then woke up at noon and played again.  So it must be cool.  Increased rating after 10 plays.  This is one of the only long games that is worth the time it takes.  (Along with Die Macher and maybe Game of Thrones)</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Italy">One of the best games ever... but it seems impossible to not miss some rule during the very long game and it seems almost impossible to recover a bad start and the leaders are more and more in control of situation. It works much better online.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">06-16-14: This was my favorite game for the longest time, but as I've refined my tastes I've had to bump this down from a '10'.  This is a very well designed game, and it is one of several Vlaada Chvatil games in our collection. But at its core it is only a puzzle solving solitaire game with multiple players. I doubt I will ever play it again with more than 3 players.  02-07-15: I think I would rate this as a 9.5/10 as a solo game, 8.5/8 as a 2-3 player game, and a 3 (!) with 4 players (official BGG rating meaning I would never ever play it with 4 again). </comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Germany">One of the best games I ever played. Tons of rules can not stop the fun I had. So, you are a expert player and like fantasy - play it now!</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Germany">What a monster of a game! The way that this game uses deck building as an underlying mechanism to control your hero in the game is absolutely brilliant. Stunning artwork, lots and lots and lots of stuff in it, this is absolutely brilliant design! The only thing that keeps me from playing this game more is the length of playing time for it, but otherwise, this is another great game from Vlaada.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">Absolutely amazing game.  I have not yet played this co-op, only solo.  It's a fantastic puzzle.  The game is solid from start to finish.  There are a lot of moving parts, but all of the systems flow together nicely.  What initially looks complex, is masterfully done and in the end, very intuitive.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">I have played this as a solitaire experience several times and still do not know what the big deal is. I don't know whether I enjoy it or not. It's odd. More plays will tell, however introducing this to the kids is a bear, and will limit the time it sees on the table.  Update: I'm thinking this is one of the finer solitaire experiences around. Bumping this from 8 to a 9+. I'm still trying to introduce this to the kids -- and to a group we assemble every so often, but without success so far. It's certainly daunting, and we find we favor games we already know well to get on the table. We'll see though.  Update: Two things regarding component quality. (1) The cards from the expansion are clearly of different finish and quality than those of the base game. Sleeving the cards solves this problem handily. (2) The expansion tiles are definitely a different shade than the tiles from the base game. Simply use dice to make the appropriate tile selection, adjusting the results to account for the remaining tiles for the scenario. I prefer a d20 for this, as you can determine one chance in two (odd/even), one chance in three (1-6, 7-12, 13-18, rerolling 19,20), one chance in four (1-5, etc.), one chance in five (1-4, etc.), one chance in six (1-3, ..., rerolling 19-20), etc.  This way, you don't have any issue with, nor do you care about how the tiles look. You have a pool from which to select, and the dice make the selection. It's always just as much of a surprise as if the tiles were in a stack.   :)</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Germany">Mage Knight is probably THE adventure game on the market right now. It has beautiful components and you really get that feeling of leveling up and advancing with your character. The difficulty of the different scenarios is quite high and challenging. The 4 different mage knights only differ in their standard decks in 1 single card and in their different skills which they gain after leveling up. I felt that they could have put some more unique cards into the according decks to give every knight a totally different approach while playing but thats okay. The game comes with various scenarios which arent predefined levels such as in  descent or other dungeon crawlers but simply set up the game and give the instructions such as number of rounds to be played and so on. Mage Knight can be played solo, cooperative and competetive, whereas cooperative feels more like a huge solo experience just with more players. The skills which were only made for this mode just show up too randomly to have any effects on the gameplay. Competetivly played this game gets another boost since you always have to watch your back. The real con of the game is its long amount of time to be played and the downtime when playing with other people.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">This game nicely encapsulates the narrative quality of a fantasy adventure tale, even with it's crunchy Euro-style hand management. Like a pen-and-paper RPG but without the time investment, Mage Knight is really good at creating a sense of story progression as your character travels the countryside, fights monsters, and learns new skills. The mechanics are elegant and engrossing (I am especially impressed with how the deckbuilding mechanic is woven into the game), and the replayability is nearly limitless. One of my all-time favorites.  (dungeon crawler; 2x)</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="">Fantastic game. Every game plays quite differently and there's always the feeling of "if only I had one more card/crystal/unit/etc". Cons would be game length (forever, but not a bad thing if you like the game and are in no hurry) and that one of the 4 player units is underpowered compared to the other 3.</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">Excellent game!  Brings a fantastic RPG feel to tabletop gaming.  I like how the deck building aspect drives the game (your options and available choices) without diluting the RPG elements.  Reasons I don't rate this higher:  (1)  Rules are not for the faint of heart (but it is emulating a RPG, so you should be expecting some rules complexity).  (2)  Not a fast play.  Yes, subsequent plays will increase speed, but the game does not lend itself to fast play.  Expect long games of this.  (3)  Bad luck early on carries through.  The rich get richer.  Success breeds success.  No catch up mechanism.  (How many different ways can I say the same thing?)  Notwithstanding the above, really an excellent game!  9/01/13:  Upping my rating to a 9.  (1) becomes better with repeated plays, as does (2).  (3) is true, but you have to be willing to push things and take some wounds.  Not the end of the world if the mob goes down, not at all.  Probably is best at 1 or 2 to avoid lengthy downtime and shorten the game.  I will be playing this more.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - It is one of the heaviest boardgames I have encountered. It combines a lot of mechanics. The game is scenario based, of which there are only a few, but the randomness of the setup makes every gameplay totally different. You start with a hero venturing out and discovering new tiles with new monsters and locations to defeat and explore, to gain precious influence, to be able to upgrade, and get on to stronger enemies. The turn is card management: you draw a number of cards and then move and take an action as your cards allow it. The combat system is very nice and usually won`t give you a bloodless fight. The rules are many, the handbook is not the greatest but the game is quite immersive. Although it can support up to 5 players, it is advisable to play in 2-player mode, as it can take up hours exploring the seemingly petit kingdom.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">Awesome game. Excellent bits and board, very immersive. It is probably my favorite 2-player game, and it is THE definitive Lord of the Rings game. If you want an epic Lord of the Rings gaming experience, this game cannot be beat.  During the game, both players must allocate their actions between the fellowship of the ring (either finding them or getting them to Mordor) and the War between the Free Peoples and the Shadow. Each nation has their own miniatures and the cards do a very good job of reenacting situations (or possible situations) from the books. The action dice are a cool part of the game that can force you to alter your strategy a bit, but still gives you a ton of choices.  The second edition has a less geographically accurate board (the game space relationships are the same, but the actual artwork is less accurate), but is superior in all other respects; looks better, bigger cards, Gollum figure included, updated rules, etc...</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">My pleasure with The Battle of Five Armies lead me to greatly desire this game and when I finally got my hands on it, it did not disappoint. While ultimately more complicated than TBoFA, it is also more epic in feel; vaster and greater in scope. The amount of miniatures is astounding and the size of the board is a wow-getter. I greatly prefer the size of the cards in WotR to the cards in TBoFA, because they're so large and satisfying to hold. Really, though, it comes down to the movement of The Fellowship and the decisions that the Free Peoples player has to make in light of the mounting Shadow forces and the disappearing bastions. The game always tells a beautiful story and when you get two experienced players going against each other, you're bound to have an intense and rewarding time.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">I love how immersive the theme is in this game&#8212;it's been said that War of the Ring is the LoTR Trilogy in a box, and I can't disagree.   Mechanically speaking, I'd prefer more depth to the combat system&#8212;if I'm rolling d6s to fight, I'd like there to be some interesting modifiers in play to limit the randomness (see: Eclipse ship parts). That's my single gripe; otherwise it's a fantastic game.  I'll probably never get my hands on a Collector's Edition, but I'm happy with the Anniversary Edition as an alternative: it's almost as beautiful.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">The ultimate Middle Earth wargame, but like many focused wargames, it carries the limitation that players will have to want to be involved in this specific event. However, it does not have to go according to plan (as per the books), and that level of variation within the War is what will keep players invested. I do not exactly have someone interested in war gaming within this universe, and it's more likely that they'd be into something like one of my LOTR card games. Rules work well, but I found them slightly counter intuitive to learn. Solid action dice mechanics, sensible combat, interesting asymmetrical play, and definitely feels like an in depth Risk-like for gamers' gamers. Components and artwork are great, really embracing the spirit of the novels instead of modern flair; though some of my figures came warped.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">Utterly brilliant.

    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Finland">[thing=164153]Imperial Assault[/thing] (2p skirmish, 2-5-player campaign, 1-2 hours per mission) There are two games in the box: the campaign game and one-shot skirmish mode (with 6 scenarios). After 2 skirmish games and 9 missions of the campaign, the game has been everything I have expected, although because this is the first game of this type to us, it should be easier to exceed my expectations.  Imperial Assault is extremely fun to play and the missions are varied (not just killing). A campaign has at least 11 missions, half of them side missions that vary between campaigns (random draw and rebels choose one from the 2+ available). The different weapons (attack dice) and defenses (defense dice) allow push-your-luck moments, and sometimes the dice are on you side and sometimes against you. You have an overall strategy, but the game is played in a very reactive, tactical way due to the alternating activations.  As the imperial player I cringe when I see the level-upped rebels take out my stormtroopers in one shot before they even get to activate on that round, but if the rebels take too long killing my troops, they neglect their objectives, and I come out on top again. And the rebels are not the only ones that get to have new abilities.  Also: I have painted the miniatures. Even a quick paint-job will make the game look amazing. (Unfortunately for a painter, every painted game needs to look better than the previous one, so a good job takes quite a while. Well, at least painting is a good peripheral hobby to go with boardgaming.) </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Luxembourg">Playing a full campaign is probably one of my best gaming moments ever. Now I need to find someone to play the campaign with... or a way to solitaire it.  Very well done and excellent components.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="United States">Amazing game, great mechanics, gorgeous minitures and components, and good replay value. Enemies in campaign must be played by someone, don't typically like this as it tends to end up being me, but still a lot of fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Wales">Tremendous, deeply thematic game - it feels lovingly crafted. I enjoyed painting the wonderful pieces. The story elements come through well and the game-system is pretty simple. </comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Sweden">Dungeoncrawler in space with Star Wars theme.   Now we&#180;ve played three missions on the core set campaign and it&#180;s soooo good. The battle keeps swaing back and forth and its almost always up to the last turn to see who wins.   This is RPG in boardgame design, the miniatures, the story of the campaign and the levelling up system and the fact you can upgrade your equipment.  Simply amazing. Havn&#180;t given it a 10 yet, but that is mostly because we haven&#180;t finished the campaign and I&#180;m afraid it gets a bit repetitive. But I don&#180;t see that happening right now.   </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="">Este juego me enganch&#243; desde el principio. La tem&#225;tica es Star Wars &#191;qu&#233; m&#225;s se puede pedir? Pues se puede pedir que la caja b&#225;sica estuviera mejor organizada por dentro porque es una verg&#252;enza. En Espa&#241;a, el precio del juego es 100 euros. Comparado con "zombicide: black plague" o "blood rage", la organizaci&#243;n es decepcionante, siendo necesario preparar insertos para almacenar el material.  No obstante, y pese a esto, tiene la mejor mec&#225;nica de juego que m&#225;s se ajusta a mis gustos. Las partidas se pasan volando, es rejugable y adictivo. Las miniaturas son buenas y algunas tienen partes deformadas que se corrigen con calor, pero se pueden pintar bien. Cuesta recordar todas las reglas y exprimirlas pero con 2 o 3 partidas es suficiente.  No he jugado escaramuzas. S&#237; el modo campa&#241;a, tanto de imperio como de rebelde. Se disfrutan ambas aunque el juego parece inclinarse por dar ventaja al bando imperial.  Jugadores: 4 o m&#225;s (si falta alguien para completar los h&#233;roes, entre todos se controla). </comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Imperial Assault" game_id="164153" location="Germany">A truly cinematic experience, only there is no re-inforcement in the form of cute Ewoks to come to your rescue. You really ARE outnumbered. But the situation is not all hopeless.</comment>

Game play, I have really enjoyed this game a lot, the draft mechanic works really well. The different strategies are fun and very menacing. In a 4 player game everyone is very engaged, which makes the game very neat and interesting till the end. I also found the 2 player game works really well, i was expecting it to be a let down, but it proved me wrong.  I see my self playing this game a lot more.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">I liked this WAY more than I expected to. The draft is delicious and presents some difficult choices, and allows for some planning as well. The area control works well, death has some sting but it never feels mean, and you can turn losses into wins if you plan it well. The blind card play for combat feels very fair as well, since losers get their cards back, and the cards have enough trickeration that you can never be fully sure what the right play is. Leveling up your clan seems to be important above all else, I got +50 pts from level bonuses at game's end, which was nearly half my points. Our quests had people working different areas, would be interesting to see more overlap, although we had PLENTY of conflict. Would be down to play again any time.  also: this is one of the few games I would recommend a broken token for. You aren't getting the expansions in the box without it</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">Great mix of macanics and theme. However there are some issues of odins thone and wolfman being overpowered.</comment>

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">This has to be one on the funnest games I have ever played.  In my opinion is is a mid-weight game that play in about 90 minutes with 4 players.  It's easy to pickup as the rules are straight forward and intuitive.  Some of the features I like best are: - Starts symmetrical and uses card drafting to become asymmetrical - Multiple strategies for winning - Has tactical as well as longer term strategy play - Very balanced, good play is rewarded, while mistakes and setbacks don't elliminate you - Theme is strong and really adds to the mindset and fun - The minis add to the gameplay</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United Kingdom">Based on one play.  I found the game to be really well designed and with easy to grasp rules and excellent tactical options, but not particularly fun.  Would play again though and it appears to have a lot of re-play value.  Like a railway building game with auction and resource management phases tacked on.  Will update with more plays.  Updated after more plays and I've got to say that I love this game.</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Sweden">Played it once (2 players) and the game seems VERY promising. Most likely even more fun with three players. Great economic simulation. Have a feeling this will become an 8 when I've tried it with three or more players.  Now an 8 (tried with 3). Might be even higher after more plays. Superb game.  Keeps growing on me. It's now a 9.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Netherlands">Wonderful game.  It took some time to 'click' within our group, but we tremendously enjoy it now, and we like the adrenaline of a close end-game.  Should I buy another coal...

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Australia">Used to be rated 8.   This game is a true classic.  So great.   this game is only let down by the terrible rulebook that makes it hard to find the several rule exceptions.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">This game completely does it for me... it's the first game with a bidding segment that I've actually enjoyed. It has cool money management and scarcity issues... I love the market forces active in the game. I need to buy this and play it as frequently as possible! UPDATE: PG is a very enjoyable game that does not seem to be losing its appeal. I really like the France map too. UPDATE: the tension in this game is excellent. It combines everything I love about games... route building, cool economics, a tense auction... I love this game!</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="United States">Several clever play mechanics mesh together to create a fairly smooth-playing, balanced game. Highly enjoyable and deeper than it first appears, with interesting tactical decisionmaking. Player interaction is present in almost all phases of the game.  Update: having owned this for several years now, I always have fun playing this, despite having to always check the rules "just to make sure".  The strategy is fairly subtle, however, and if you're a person who likes to play all-out in whatever game you play, then this game isn't for you.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Wales">I've read a lot that 2 player is the worst way to play it and I can see the potential with more, but I've enjoyed several 2 player games of this. Would be interested to try it with the Robots expansion to enhance the competitive aspects. I love the mechanic with regards to goods availability and pricing. The imagery is nice on the cards. It's a shame that the theme won't appeal to everyone at a first glance. If not for the theme I think this would be very accessible.  Games with three and four players have confirmed that this is a great Euro-style game merging route-planning, a nice little catch-up mechanic, an enjoyable auction phase, and some neat resource management. Not a short game, but worth investing time in. It has become one of my favourite games.</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Poland">2010-04-14 (rating 9):  An excellent game. Seems very mathy. Only a little randomness just to make every game a little different. Exactly what I like.  Also the theme is fine with me. The game scales well for different number of players. There is nothing more I could want in a game.</comment>

The auctions get some good table-talk, because buying just the right priced power plant can be quite powerful.  DISLIKE: Can be math heavy at times. Calculators help, but slow the game down. The power plant expansions don't always work with some maps (japan seemed broken, but ok with germany).   OVERALL: Fun theme, lots of strategies, highly interactive. </comment>

I originally scored this as a 7 but upgraded to a 9. Would be a 10 but for the missile issue. I would rather play this now rather than Space Empire.  Just played my first six player game and added the expansion. Now must say " What missile issue". Just rated this a 10 its that good.  Back to a 9. Its great but not enough combat for me.</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Malaysia">Eclipse has clean, streamlined mechanics &amp; very well-designed, we played the game smoothly &amp; straightforward without feeling convoluted with the rules, thanks to the ever ready player reference cards.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Canada">Wow. Lots to do, many paths to victory and cool theme. Mostly resource managing in space but elegantly designed and fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">Absolutely incredible experience. Think Euro economic mechanics (a la Power Grid) meets territory control and combat (a la Risk), but with tech trees and customizable ships (a la the Civ video game series), all set within something like the Mass Effect universe.  Eclipse blends Euro mechanics with a great theme and fun combat mechanics. While the rulebook looks daunting, it is very well laid out, with a good portion devoted to a play-by-play example game. Couple that with UndeadViking's great how-to video, and you should be up and running in no time.  While Eclipse looks quite complicated, a graceful and elegant game lies behind the imposing appearance. With only 6 actions to choose from, the gameplay is streamlined and sensible.  The components are well-built, the art is great, and the player mat is extremely well designed and straightforward.  I had an absolute blast playing, and I can't wait to get it to the table again.</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Poland">my first (and I suppose only, for now) 4X board game. one of the greatest. </comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United Kingdom">Fun game with some great mechanics.</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">A tight, well-designed Euro-style ruleset with very little clutter makes for very close, very strategic games. I'm especially a fan of the starship upgrade mechanic, which introduces a ton of variety and flexibility to your military tactics.  There is one semi-dominant military strategy, which is balanced out in the expansion; I don't recommend playing without Rise of the Ancients.  (Euro; 2x)</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="United States">Very very very VERY fun game!  It has several shades of wargame to make it very fun, but primarily about running economics of empire.  This combination means it appeals to players not big on fighting as well as those thirsting for some battles.   Was expecting to play this with brother/friends.  When my wife found out it was limited to 9 rounds, she agreed to give it a try. She loved it. Then she convinced my sister-in-law, who prefers non-confrintational games, to give it a try. She liked it too!!! That's how strong the economic side of the game is, it drew them both in.  Looks like we are going to be playing this a lot!</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Canada">After a few games it gets even better!!!</comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Brazil">It was the first scy fi game I've played, and I have a very good care of this one, it is relatively simple and elegant, beautiful.  The best part in this game is the way you build the blueprints of your ships, researching tecnology to build new wepon, shield, computer, energy source, hull. The customization of your ship and build for combat is great.  The way you track the incomming of the resources is very elegant, too, despite of the long setup.  Tecnology track is good, but there is an unecessary randomness here, the way to mitigate this is trying to be the first player, to guarantee the best tecnology available first. The alternate order of play variant, or the order of pass play variant makes this even better and fair. The only problem here is that some key strategies may not work if you need an advanced economy, or advanced science, mining.  The exploration is very interesting and makes the game change every new play. Of course you can be stuck if you find just ancient ships in the first round and be surrounded by them and be not possible to colonize the new sectors discovered. But in the other hand when you fight them, if you fight them earlier, you have a good chance to collect better reputation.  The combat is simple and functional, and have lots of modifiers depending on the type of wepon, quantity of cannons, difference between the computer and the shield and of course the thick of the hulls.  The different races put an assimetry of play in this game, after some plays it seems balanced.  I love to play this game.</comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Great game, sadly I never get to play </comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Core x3 + all expansions owned  I never played the original Netrunner and I initially ignored this upon it's release despite a large following in my local group.  Curiosity got the best of me and I asked to play one game just to see what it was all about.  Now here I am over 50 play later and I can't get enough.  I enjoy the LCG delivery system for the game much more than when I used to play MtG and I feel as though you get A LOT of game for your money with this one.  Ok, so after playing in a couple tournaments for this game so far I have come to the conclusion that this is a great and really fun game that has a horrible tournament structure.  The amount of luck in this game really makes it difficult to come up with a fair way of playing a tournament structure that doesn't take up a prohibitively large amount of time to play.  As the corp you can get horribly unlucky with your draw and mulligan being full of agendas.  As the runner you can luck in to a ton of points early and just coast.  Winning the first game is a huge advantage going in to the second game if it goes to time.  I'm not sold on the tournament structure overall, but this is still a great game for casual and league play.</comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Canada">Great LCG. Still only have the base game as I don't really have anyone to play with that is willing to buy into it themselves. So we just play the starter decks. Update: Now have 1 data pack and an opponent to play against more frequently. Still Very Fun Playing this game more and more and its getting more and more fun. Update2: More and More packs!!!! This game is sweet</comment>

    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="">2 player asymmetrical living card game. It's deadly and tense, and evolves every month.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Germany">Very nice asymmetrical game. The base game comes with 7 different factions right out of the box, which each play very differently. Tense and close games are nearly granted every game. There is some minor luck factor involved e.g. by drawing cards from R&amp;D and getting a 3 pts. agenda.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Switzerland">I stop playing the game because i did not have the time and energy to create new decks all the time but I have to admit this is such a clever and innovative game that I wish I had more time to dedicated to it. If you like cleve game and that you have some time to invest in deck creation...just go for it...it's that brilliant !</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">+ The theme/setting is very captivating and the mechanics of the game make it so that playing the game takes as much thought as building your deck. - As with any LCG/CCG, new players have a significant amount of cards to get their head around before enjoying the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United Kingdom">Amazing game after playing CCG for over 10 years competitively i have found a card game again i enjoy playing </comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Netrunner is incredible. It is extremely well-designed and there's nothing out there quite like it, even among other competitive card games. It's also ridiculously thematic, with an extremely well fleshed-out (and diverse!) universe. Easily one of my all-time favorites.  (LCG; 4x)</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="">Much more skill / much less dependence upon pre-game deckbuilding as opposed to MtG. I approve.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">Becomes a bluffing game due to the hidden information on the corp side.  There are lots of choices to make and so many of them are important.  The runner needs to be bold, but so does the corporation.  Money is very tight and that ends up driving everything.  (And I mean EVERYTHING.)  I'm still wrapping my head around the deckbuilding aspect, but the LCG nature makes me happy-ish.  An excellent implementation of an old CCG.  Makes me wonder what I should do with my old Netrunner CCG cards.</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="United States">This game has it all: excellent theme, asymmetric play, outside of game deck building, evolving meta, manageable price point.  There is no better 2 player game around!</comment>
    <comment game="Android: Netrunner" game_id="124742" location="Australia">Fantastic game.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">Not really a "party" game - too thinky. Let's just call it a group game, but probably one of the best in games that goes up to 8+.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="Australia">The perfect party game - good for people without the confidence and/or chutzpah needed to get actively involved in Resistance/Secret Hitler/Snake Oil, but still provides great fun, great laughs, and a great atmosphere. 100% recommendation</comment>

    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">[2-12] This has been a huge hit with every group that I've played it with. In fact, nearly every group eventually has bought their own copy. The brilliance is the way in which it adapts to the group itself, which allows for a very wide-ranging play experience.</comment>
    <comment game="Codenames" game_id="178900" location="United States">It's an excellent game.  Hardcore gamers like it, and party gamers like it.  It's significantly more fun to be the clue-giver than the guesser.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">This game is one of the best there is to marry awesome solo play and awesome multi-player play. The theme is perfect for all 'types' of player personalities. More replayability than almost any game I know. The rulebook is a terrible disservice  and the only reason I couldn't give this a 10.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United Kingdom">Amazing game, but requires to right group of roughly equal experience - otherwise finding the balance between not being an Alpha player and not dying horribly can be tricky.</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="">Every part is visually stunning. The game is so immersive and rich i can see myself playing it for a long long time.  It just hits all the buttons for me. </comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Got a chance to play this with 3 and really enjoyed it.  A longer game, but I felt the theme came through extremely well, and the game was challenging and interesting.  Will absolutely be picking it up when it comes out in America.  -- This actually sounds amazing.  Slipped under my radar somehow, but will most likely be picking it up. </comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Story, story, story, story, story. This is about the story, and this does it better than any other game of its kind. Absolutely brilliant.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="">Excellent game, but my rating is solely based on my solitaire games, therefore it might change.  Makes you think on the spot and feels like an experience when left with limited choices on what to do. I love atmospheric games where I can immerse myself into. I could do with a longer play time but I assume most people love the 1 1/2 to 2 hour game of a scenario.  Fantastic game!  The rulebook is fine as it is. </comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">Very good game with rules that are a bit on the hard to understand side.  But when I play it with players that know the rules it's one of the best games of the past couple of years.</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Hong Kong">First feeling with the game is not bad, but some of the rules are confusing... Second play and rerated the game to 8 from 7. Rules cleared but still feeling a bit tedious... Third play and rules cleared. Rate it 9, but this is a gamers' game (rules more complicated than other similar games such as Power Grid or Puerto Rico), won't recommend it for family!</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Australia">Fantastic "efficiency engine" game with great strategic depth, marred slightly by an overly long playing time and maybe a touch too much luck.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">This may possibly be a better game than Age of Steam. Not sure yet though... the board is a mess and a nightmare that might be laid out a bit better, but that doesn't mean the game underlying that physical design isn't wonderful. I will need more plays of this to get a handle on this more clearly.  Update: This game has been one of the harder to "grok", but the more layers I reveal, the more I realize there is to come. Simply brilliant.</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United Kingdom">Magic business game with great theme about the industrial revolution in the North West of England - definitely one of my favourite games as there is development, some route building, a demand market and LOADS to think about each turn as each player's actions will affect your strategy. Works well with the smaller, 2p variant map as well. May well become a 10.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">Took me a while to understand how to play the cards, not blame the cards. But the uniqueness of this game is satisfying and well worth going out of your way to experience.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Poland">Outstanding!!!! The game with exceptional rules and outstanding ambiance. The best game by Martin Wallace, only two other economic games, Agricola and Power Grip can give you equal level of fun and excitement from the play.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Poland">excellent game. almost flawless, maybe except for being prone to analysis-paralysis love the theme, love the mechanics</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Finland">2010/08 After 1st play: Absolutely fantastic. I kept smiling through the whole game and afterwards everyone was speculating about the outcome. This truly is a sign of a great game. However, being conservative I give Brass a rating of 9. We'll see if it deserves a full ten.   2013/01 Well, Brass didn't earn that 10 but it's still going strong after several plays. I really have to complain about the rulebook but that's the Wallace standard and cannot be helped. Furthermore, the rules are not very intuitive but eventually you'll get a hang of it.  2015-11-04 To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. It seems that nowadays the games hitting the table are action packed sub 90 minute games instead of longer ones like Brass. Moreover, the complexity of the rules in Brass forces an occasional player to reread the rules every single time you want to bring the game into the table. This reduces the chances of Brass getting played. If I only had more space to store my games...</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United Kingdom">Another of Wallace's greats, not sure if I prefer this to AoI mostly because it's harder to get a group of 4 players who know the system well enough to play properly. Once I've played a few times under those circumstances I can probably compare them better.  I do find the develeopment of level 1 tiles and dominance of railways to be rather overwhelming but I've mostly only played with newbies, I suspect a lot of the different scoring paths are all worthwhile if played well and railways will probably even out. </comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Italy">Il capolavoro di Wallace (o almeno credo.. il buon Martino ha una produzione immensa di giochi di grande livello).  Due fasi distinte (canali/ferrovie), industrie che vanno in obsolescenza, vie di trasporto comuni che creano un'interazione a volte fastidiosissima, gestione dei debiti perfetta.  Un gioco che non invecchia mai, anzi andrebbe preso ad esempio per la profondit&#224; che restituisce a fronte di un corpo di regole affatto complicato.</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">The game itself is easy to learn, but really fun and difficult to master. I give 8 stars for the game and 1 more star for the great quality components in this deluxe edition. The board has 2 sides; one for 3-4 players and the other for 2 players. I found that 2-player variant is good enough. The box comes with organizer and real metal coins. Recommended to own.</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United Kingdom">Initial impression after one game was that this is an excellent business game at the weightier end of the genre. Many decisions to take and the route to making good future decisions is unclear to me after one game. I was taught the game rather than read the June 2007 rules, but there is alot to take in. An exciting release to look forward to in Essen. Initial rating 8, than could raise to 9.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">A fun game!  I rather like how there is a clear sense of progression and development as the game plays out.  I can see some potential for lockout/screwage, but since I have yet to see someone really suffer from it I don't think it's a big problem (if a problem at all).  9/04/13 - Upgraded from 8 to 9.  I love this game!  The cards drive your strategy but they're still flexible enough not to pigeonhole you.  I really like how the game plays out.  Plus, it's not too onerous to teach and playing time is usually not too high.  An excellent game!</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">Bought this game on a whim with some suggestions from other people, and I haven't been disappointed.  It's definitely fiddly and can take a very long time with new players, but it's got a great feel of playing the economic game, building a VP and income engine, a variety of viable strategies, and a ton of player interaction that really wouldn't be expected for a Euro of this type.  A lot more than Terra Mystica, for example.  Components are nice, even if the visuals are a bit dated.</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="United States">2-4(3,4)  Still 2p variant only. I think I could play this over and over. It's a bit fiddly (delivery / connection rules, keeping track of spending, etc.), but you get the hang of it. The cleverness of all the available options and how they fit together (there are no "fallback" options ... even taking loans could be a strong play). There are certain guidelines (it's really nice to have coal out, and to have developed through your chaff by the end of canals) but otherwise you have to be very reactive and clever to respond to the ebbs and flows of demand. Especially in things like ensuring that the coal or iron you put out there won't help your opponent!  I don't enjoy lots of multiplayer games with two because the negotiation elements become zero-sum and flattens the strategy (Small World is an example here), but with Brass it doesn't, somehow, feel that way. It feels like Wallace has turned the very clever trick of making these sorts of decisions mutually beneficial and it's up to each player to individually consider who benefits best. Great economic game.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Canada">To me Le Havre is extremely underrated. I think this is way better than Agricola. There is always something cool and productive you can do on your turn. You can play vastly different from game to game because of the way the buildings are ordered randomly. You can also shoot for points in multiple ways. You could collect a bunch of buildings for points, you could build lots of ships, you could buy a few ships and ship lots of goods, you could make lots of high value goods and only ship small amounts of them, and I'm sure there are more ways to get points that I'm forgetting. There is a decent amount of special buildings to choose from and I've barely seen any of them yet. This is one of the first games I ever bought and it's still great.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">After several plays I now enjoy this game.  Want a couple of 3 player games to see how it plays.  All games have been with 4 players which makes it a bit long.  Otherwise it an almost perfect game.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Extremely tight resource management game.  balancing food, loans, building materials, and the ever increasing number of building options is tough.  It is actually not a difficult game to play, just a difficult game to play optimally.</comment>

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Spain">Para mi, lo mejor de Rosenberg, un excelente juego de gesti&#243;n, con un elemento de presi&#243;n fuerte y con multitud de opciones para lograr la victoria, de explicaci&#243;n sencilla y buena duraci&#243;n. Es de ensalzar el gran trabajo que realiz&#243; Uwe para lograr una escalabilidad casi perfecta, cuyo &#250;nico escollo para 4-5 jugadores es que la duraci&#243;n se dispara (sobre todo en la versi&#243;n completa)</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="England">I was expecting this to be pretty dry, which is rather disappointing for a harbour! My rating shows how much I enjoyed the game, although having the 5 player long version of the game as my first outiing was a baptism of fire. Good mechanics and decision taking, with a point taken off the rating for the length of the five player game. Hopefully will try it 2 or 3 player soon to see how it feels at the other end. Highly recommended.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Spain">Juego profundo de gesti&#243;n de recursos, con unas mec&#225;nica relacionadas con el Agr&#237;cola pero con todav&#237;a m&#225;s opciones, muy abrumador al principio, y todav&#237;a m&#225;s calculador, de gesti&#243;n m&#225;s fr&#237;a. Probado en una partida a 3, a espera de m&#225;s, para valorarlo mejor.   Con m&#225;s partidas, mejora much&#237;simo el asunto, es un juegazo de gesti&#243;n de recursos! En mi opini&#243;n es bastante mejor que el Agr&#237;cola y algo mejor por la rejugabilidad comparado con el Ora el Labora que me gusta mucho.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Very interesting game. Has some of the Agricola flavor, but I think it better than its predecessor. Clearly has a good game arc, nad has some copetition and conflict between the players, but without the action "starvation" that Agricola can have. I always felt I could do something productive.  I enjoyed it a lot, as both a 4 player and a 2 player.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Netherlands">I like Agricola but Le Havre is so much better in many aspects. It feels more economic than Agricola is, we have raw materials (that can be upgraded to other materials) that we have to produce, sell, etc. The components are ok but the ideas in the game really make a wonderful experience out of it. </comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Estonia">Very good game also, teaches a lot about resources and money.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Another win on the heavy strategy side for designer Uwe Rosenberg.  I probably prefer this entry slightly to Agricola, though others I've gamed with seem to find Agricola to be more approachable.    This still feels varied enough to me from Uwe's later masterpiece, [I]Ora et Labora[/I], to warrant keeping--though it definitely doesn't feel as though it has as many varied paths to victory.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">[1-4] Wow.  What a great economic engine going on here.  Despite the fact that it really turns into a brain burner at the end rounds, I really love the incredibly diverse roads to victory (or cold hard coins).  Can't wait to play it with more people!  Expansions owned: [thing=65996]Le Grand Hameau[/thing]</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">Great game. Abstract but really fits the theme well so it doesn't feel as abstract as other games. One of my favorite games. Only negative I can say about this game is the length of time it takes. I'm sure there are players that play faster but on average for four players we've been at 3 1/2 to 4 hours. I feel this game is worth it though it may not hit the take as often due to that time sink. I highly recommend you try before you buy. This game is actually fun to play solo as well.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">A different feel than Agricola. Food is not quite so painful to obtain, but often you still need to devote an entire turn to do so.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Denmark">I'm sure that with more games played this rating will rise. Allready happend once  A good and very interesting economic game, that needs a little getting use to. just like Agricola  I recoment play with only 3 players when learning the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">An interesting game of worker placement and building/ship construction.  Similar to [GAMEID=31260] in a few respects (e.g., food requirement, action selection, blocking other players), but more economic since it includes buying/selling and a lot of goods conversion (upgrading).  I like it.  It feels tighter in some ways, potentially harsher than [GAMEID=31260] but more flexible.  Need additional plays to really pin it down.  Game length is an issue, though it should become less prohibitive with experienced players.  Rating may improve with additional plays.  Rating bumped from 7 to 8 (4/27/09).  The more I play this, the more I want to play it.  My first 4 plays have been of the shorter variety (a 3-p, two solo's &amp; a 4-p).  I'm liking it more and more, appreciating the different strategies or, at the very least, the different directions.  I suspect this one will shine even more in the longer variety with the special buildings.  Rating bumped from 8 to 9 (5/08/09).  I like this one [i]much[/i] better than [GAMEID=31260].  There is a definite progression to the game due to the expanding "tech tree" and increasing number of options as buildings are constructed.  There are a few different strategies to consider.  Food, and entry fees, can become a severe limiting factor, but there are a few ways to anticipate this and plan accordingly.  The biggest downsides are game length and having to use the short version for intro games.  Further comments (5/29/09).  The long game is *MUCH* better than the short game.  There's a greater sense of development and resources in the early portion become more critical.  In addition, the special buildings make the game more diverse and differentiated among plays.  That's another interesting thing -- the game can vary a lot among plays, and not just from player choices.  Order and arrangement of the building piles, order of the 7 turn supply markers, the special buildings at work -- these all combine to produce very different, diverse games.  I want to play more long games.  I am [i]really[/i] enjoying this game!  (It's better than [gameid=31260]!  *gasp*)  More comments (6/29/09):  The long game is the only/best way to go.  I'm now teaching others with the long game.  Much better than the short game.  The special buildings have the potential for dictating, or at least suggesting, new avenues to pursue.  While shipping &amp; building are the two dominant strategies, there are so many flavors to pursue and options to consider that I'm not losing interest at all.  Plano-type boxes are a must for short setup time.  Check out the sewing section at your local craft store for small boxes.  Negatives:  Play time is a bit long for the game.  Fair bit of downtime on other players' turns.  Don't play with the AP-inclined.  Relatively steep learning curve -- lots to learn, assimilate and assess.  Still, I really like this one and I don't see that changing any time soon.  Additional comments (7/08/09):  Teaching this game is difficult.  There's a lot to cover and new players' eyes will likely glaze over at the 5 or 10 min. mark.  Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done about that.  In addition, experienced players will have a dramatic advantage over new players.  There's a distinct learning curve that some people may not traverse or may not be willing to traverse.  I think there's a great game on the other side, but not all will agree or be willing to play this one again.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Canada">Amazingly fun!  Plays really well with 2 players.  3 is good, 4 is nice, 5 is way too long!</comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United Kingdom">Excellent fun, nice mix of card play, tile laying and resource production.  Fabulous production quality, beautiful artwork on the cards and board, it all just looks sensational.  Our 4 player game took us about 4 hours but everyone was very absorbed and didn't notice the time pass.  With plenty of interesting ways for players to interact the only thing we weren't so keen on was the "remove some plants from another player" type of event which came up fairly frequently.  Seeing as you might have invested quite some time and effort to get the right number of plants you needed at the right time, it was a little frustrating when another player would play a card that happened to include the side effect of destroying some of them.   We're not fans of "Take that" mechanisms in general, but despite that, we thought the game was brilliant and would happily play again.  Tip: keep your player board some distance in front of you.  The marker cubes you place on it are easily scattered by a passing sleeve.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Serbia">After 3 games I can conclude that I very much like this game. It has everything I like in a game: huge pool of different cards, engine building, good amount of player interaction, area control and blocking others...  There are a few things that I don't like, but they don't affect gameplay - graphic design could have been better and the player board... is not just ugly, but the UX is just plain bad. Markers can be bumped, marking your production over 10 is just clunky. It should have been a lot better.  Regarding the gameplay, I can see that it may be possible that this game could suffer from "bad hand drawn" (as any other card driven game) but we are still to see if that has that much influence since you can mitigate bad draws in lots of ways.  For now, this is a solid 9 for me. One of the top games on my shelf. I hope it stays that way.  We've tried it with: 2 players - good 4 players - fantastic </comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Excellent game!  I love the balance between income and playing cards.  While the choices felt too broad my first game, it really is just a matter of learning the game.  There are a number of strategies and, while luck of the card draw can push-pull on them, I feel that there are enough draws to mitigate this in the long run (over a game).  It's like Race for the Galaxy - you have to learn which cards to play and which cards to ignore and when to do each.  I will play this again.  Rating could improve (to a 10) with more plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United Kingdom">Glorious. Stands a good chance of being upgraded to a 10 if the long term re-playability is as good as I think it will be.</comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Amazing Euro game with a scientific twist. We have all been hearing about this game for months, so there isnt much I can write here that has not already been written, however, based on the fact I gave it a 9 means I quite enjoy it.   Another gamer in our group recently purchased Terra Mystica, and after a few play through of that, we found we really enjoyed those mechanics, so we were hoping this would offer some of the same which it does. I have played 3 times now, and really look forward to it hitting the table a lot more in the future.   Solo Play - As an intro to teach others, I  attempted it once, and I didn't have a great grasp on the rules, so it went pretty bad. I look forward to playing again with a full grasp on the rules.  3 Player game - We all played with the beginner corp and no advanced cards. The game went slow and we missed a few (major) rules. All three of us really enjoyed it and looked forward to playing again.  4 Player game - We have done one 4 player game so far. It went well, 3 of the players had played once and one was new. The 3 selected our corporations and the newbie used the beginner corp as per the instructions. We used all advanced corp cards as well, which made a huge difference. The game went well but dragged...4+ hours.  Pros - Too many to name, but the biggest that comes to mind is the theme of it all. There are real reasons behind what you're doing, when you do it. The mechanics are solid, but the theme makes sense and when the two work together, it really shines.  Cons - the art is not very consistent. It seems to be photo-realistic in some areas, and cartoonish in others. The player and resource pieces are too small and light. This would be fine if they just sat, but there is a lot of movement and a lot of them. It can be very difficult to keep tabs on them etc. The length is a bit off from whats on the box. Of the 3 games I've played, the average length is about 3 hrs. I suppose it could get down to around 2.5 if you really pushed the standard projects, but 90 mins?...I don't think that's possible for our group.  Calling those things "cons" is tough because its like knocking Super Mario Bros. for poor graphics. It all comes down to game play, theme &amp; mechanics, which this has nailed.  Terraforming Mars is an amazing game, and is an instant classic. Get it.</comment>

I can literally visualize planning moves ahead in time and I can watch other players do the same. Individual player powers at the beginning of the game are just imbalanced enough to make it fun. Cool components too.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">One of my favorite games. When it comes to worker placement, this is one of the best.

Escala bien a pesar de los trabajadores neutrales aunque es m&#225;s interesante jugando con 4. El tema no est&#225; mal elegido pero el juego es muy euro puro, muy seco, abstracto y sesudo. Tras varias partidas te das cuenta que la partida depende de la config inicial tanto de losetas de jugador, como sobretodo de los tipos de edificios, y aun as&#237; hay diferentes estrategias por las que optar, dependiendo tambi&#233;n del n&#250;mero de jugadores y del desarrollo de la partida: hacerse con los templos, con los edificios, o con las calaveras... etc. por no decir la elecci&#243;n de conseguir trigo o transformarlo, y sobretodo la elecci&#243;n de hacerte o no con m&#225;s trabajadores, para hacer m&#225;s acciones, teniendo en cuenta su mayor coste de mantener.

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United States">A great, "spin" on worker placement, Tzolkin is easily one of my favorite games with the action drafting mechanism. You play workers onto one of several gears. Each gear is turning during play and associated with a family of actions that enable specific strategems in play to be executed. In order to take an action, you must remove one of your placed workers at the right time and position on the said gear. This is the core of the game that all the other mechanisms and options of the game rest on. Other than a fragile board, I find I have nothing negative to say about Tzolkin. I am glad I picked it up at pax east a few years ago and will probably never get rid of it.</comment>

This us a "heavier" game that My non gamer wife actually seems to like. So home run IMO.</comment>

Some scenarios emphasize puzzles more than action and vice versa. This is a unique consumable board game experience. Worth every penny!</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">1st play: We played the full first campaign from start to finish and it was awesome.  The story is engaging, the twists and turns are surprising and the production and art tie everything together.  This is the experience that I was hoping to get from Pandemic Legacy, and it's honestly a lot better.  I don't mind that each story is only playable once, because 4 people were enteretained for 4 hours, making this game a great deal compared to other forms of entertainment.  I'm a little apprehensive because I've heard that other stories aren't as good as the first, and I really want that not to be true.  But this game is a must-play, the experience is unmatched.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Germany">Great game. Rare to see a time travel theme done well. Good mechanics.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Amazingly thematic and memorable game. Why oh why did they have to start out with such a dark theme? Borrowed it from a friend and played it with my 18, 15 and 13 year olds and it was on the edge of ok for the youngest. Really looking forward to playing the different themed expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Canada">I don't know how this game could be any better beyond being replayable, but that's an intended side effect of where they did everything else so very right. Asylum is a fantastic scenario and I look forward to more. Only problem is the price tag for an experience that's only great once (per story), but the experience wouldn't have been so great without the story being consumed.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Canada">Great game as long as you know that you're likely only going to play each story once. I'm really looking forward to playing other people's scenarios, and writing my own. :)</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">What a stunner this is. With beautiful visual aesthetics and intuitive, easy to teach rules, T.I.M.E. stories is more or less an old school adventure video game given cardboard flesh and 2-4 player interaction. The mechanics themselves are fairly basic, with a neat die &amp; token system for challenge resolution, but the fact you the insert of the box can also be used as a convenient SAVE STATE for unfinished missions is nothing short of astounding. The one thing it has going against it is that once you've gone through a Mission it won't offer you any surprise, but you can always play dumb so friends can enjoy it and make your own decisions randomly. Also, unlike Pandemic Legacy, you don't destroy the components, so you could lend it out to friends to enjoy while you await future Mission packs (which are a few dollars too pricey, I'll admit). The storytelling in 'Asylum' is quite good, so I can't wait for future scenarios and a possible meta-narrative to emerge.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">When TIME Stories was first released and getting the buzz, I was very skeptical. I was particularly put off by the lack of replay-ability of each scenario.  Luckily someone else in my group bought it.  I have played the first two modules now and I have to admit this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had bar none.  There are some truly unforgettable moments to be had here, and sacrifice of repeat plays is really worth it.  It's not a trivial cost, but it's one you should be willing to bear in order to play this game.   It succeeds on all levels.  Real, meaty decisions.  Careful puzzle solving. Engrossing stories.  Really fantastic product.</comment>

The theme, story and artwork are very good.  Asylum: -The art is very horroristic. :) -Some nice puzzles. -I did not like the asylum theme, it was a bit depressing to play.

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United Kingdom">Dodgy rulebook. That's all the negatives out of the way.   I really don't get this one played enough, it's very mechanical but everything comes together wonderfully. Very satisfying.   I am rather dubious about the higher player counts though, I will probably try it with 5 and see how it goes. I fear downtime will rear its ugly head with more to keep track of and more players to act before you.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Canada">A game of worker placement and bidding that lasts 4 rounds, scales from 2-6(!) players, is innovative despite using some familiar mechanics, and has high variability.  There are 4 seasons (rounds) in the game and each round a set number of tiles are laid out (this is where a large amount of the variability is introduced as there is a large number of different/unique tiles in the game), as well as a set number of boats carrying new workers and their skills into the new world.  A players turn is simple to execute but difficult to choose; you have the following options: 1) bid on a tile, 2) increase an existing bid on a tile, 3) utilize a tile, your own, another players or the ones currently up for bid, or 4) exchange workers.  The twist with the bidding and actions are that everything is colour specific; there are 4 colours in the game, and once a colour is used on a tile, only those workers of that colour can be used.  At the end of a round, winning bids collect their tiles and bring them into their own villages which involves a bit of tile-laying planning.  There are two main benefits of having your own tiles:1) any workers used on a tile are retained instead of lost at the end if around, and 2) the tiles are one of the main ways to score points (however they must be "flipped" in order to be worth points and this flipping also upgrades the tiles abilities.  The last game round is slightly different in that each player introduces their own tiles into the bidding pool and these tiles only function is for end game scoring.    Gameplay is quick but thoughtful, there is a large amount of variety from game to game, it's works great at all player numbers, and the theme is decent.

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Great game, ingeniously combining several game mechanics (auction, worker placement, tile laying, to name a few) in engaging ways. It hits the Goldilocks sweet spot for my gaming group (not too long/short or light/heavy). Haven't had to introduce them the Farmers expansion yet...but soon. :)</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Outstanding game!  Have played 2, 3, 4 and 6 players.  Scales very nicely.  Might get to a 10 on my list. </comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Canada">I love this game. Lots of decisions.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United Kingdom">This is a seriously good game! It has a lot of depth of strategy for such a simple looking game.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Germany">Weight: 4/5 Player: 2-6 (best: 2-3) Time: 90m  Summary: Genius mix between worker placement, bidding, resource logistic, and tile laying game. Colored workers are either used to produce resources or to bid for new tiles. You may loose your workers to other players which is a fantastic game mechanic.  I love how simple the bids are assigned to each player just by placing your workers on the right side of the hexagonal tile. Nobody knows exactly how many workers each player has left, so there is a push-your-luck element while bidding which is very exciting.  It's also very satisfying to build and upgrade your own town so that it produces the resources or workers which score you points at the end of the game. The last (winter) round is brilliant, because each player decides which of his score-bringing winter tiles he puts into play. These winter tiles are then used for bidding, so other players are able to snag "your" winter tile.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Sweden">Keyflower is a game that has really grown on me recently. Many of the elements in the game are borrowed from other games, but the mix is original. Auction bidding, bluffing, tile-placement and even recource-managment are all parts of this brilliant design. When you first look at the game you will probably think that is not much depth to it because of the Carcasonne -feel with meeples and cute little city-tiles.  The decisions in this game are though, despite how the game look, very hard to make. I have a feeling this is a game that will stick. The more I play it, the more I like it.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United Kingdom">Played pre-release version. The familiar Breese traits of multiple options in this Key game are present, but in this game resource cubes are used to upgrade resource hextiles, rather than converted into different cubes. This change from other Key games makes Keyflower have a fresh feel.   The games has 4 rounds each of which present a myriad of options, which means that games will be radically different. Player interaction is high as there is bidding for all hex tiles and you can use other player's tiles as well as your own. The number of choices you have is high and you need an initial game to get the hang of these.   Early days yet but this might be the best Key game.</comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Netherlands">I've played this over 50 times online now, and I haven't grown the least bit tired of it yet. Can't wait to play my copy with expansions. I've played mostly two player, though also with three and four. I like the lower player counts the most. It has a strange feeling of being a very open game, while also being tense and cut-throat. Openness in that you can increase your bid for a tile, or even remove your bid and use the bidded workers somewhere else. You can even place your workers on a tile that is up for bid and use its action. You can use tiles in your own village for their action, or in another player's village. You can use a space that has already been used by a worker by simply using the same color of worker there, plus one (so if there is one yellow worker on the tile, you can take that action by putting two yellow workers on that tile, up to a maximum of three workers). Even the main final scoring tiles are up for auction and can be bid on by all players (each player gets a hand of three final scoring tiles at the start of the game, kept secret, and then must put at least one out for auction, or even all three). The game is cut-throat in that you can outbid a player for a tile they really need, or even block them from using their own tile in their village You maybe see that the worker batch your opponent took last round was almost entirely yellow and red workers, with one blue...you have several blue workers, so on your first move, you put two blue workers on that space, assuming he doesn't have three to use to activate it. Or, you can be very mean and just put three workers on a tile and completely block your opponent from using it. So while you are building your own village and taking actions that will let you upgrade your village tiles, maximize scoring opportunities, etc., you can also block your opponent from acquiring and/or using tiles.   +Key Celeste +The Farmers +The Merchants</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Greece">Very fresh combinations of mechanics! Nothing less from what I've expected! </comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Greece">A very nice game which blends auction, worker and tile placement all together in! There is enough luck in some tiles that may not come out and in the luck of the draw for the initial meeples and the stuff in the boats later on but I believe that's what makes this game interesting. It plays well with any player count but as there are more players there is more chaos and more downtime. With less players you feel you can handle the game more and follow a certain path to victory. A very pleasant surprise for me, I love Carcassonne by the way and it's my favourite light euro game so I'd say this is Carcassonne advance for me!</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">I love this game. Only thing holding it back from being a 10 is the cumbersome end-game scoring. Ugh. </comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Canada">Beautiful, smart, fun and challenging worker placement game. This pretty much does it all: drafting, bidding, adding tiles onto your town, and screwing over everyone around you.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">There really isn't another game quite like Keyflower.  This worker-placement/auction hybrid...thing is based around a clever little system of matching-colored meeples being used to purchase and use various tiles in a series of pilgrim villages.  It's got solid weight to it and the strategy space is huge, plus it looks great and plays well anywhere in its range - a rare thing for a game.  I am, however, really bad at it =[  My main issue is that the variance can be really nasty at lower player counts - we've had games where no iron generating tiles are revealed at all, and games where someone goes deep into wood and no VP tiles for wood are revealed at all.  I guess that's what that Summer boat is for...</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">The best euro I have played in a long time. It immediately gripped me from play one and I always want to play more of it. The auctions work very well and the actual building of our town feels rewarding and meaningful. I cannot recommend it enough to anyone who has ever enjoyed a euro game.</comment>

    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">At the very least: The best board game I played in 2010. Currently my favourite board game.  This game takes civilization building to a whole new level and plays in 30 minutes no matter how many people are playing (from 2 to 7).  Players only directly interact with their immediate neighbours and everyone selects and plays cards all at once. These two mechanics keep the game very fast-paced and fun!  Players can also choose different paths to victory: You can go military and try to beat up on your neighbours, go for science and try to get massive points in the final turns, go for wonders for unique benefits... so much more. No two games will be exactly the same. The same strategy will not always work.  The only thing I dislike about this game is the make-shift two-player variant, but the box does not even advertise that it can be played with two players so I'm fine with it.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="">I have played this game over 200 times.... I think that says it all. Addictive. Best with the expansion Leaders.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">Have played the game now about 10 times with 3 to 5 players and have enjjoyed all the games.  What is so good is the game length stays the same with more players.  Well thought out game.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="Australia">My personal gateway game, 7 Wonders is amazing, yet very difficult to teach. The reliance on symbolism, as well as the way production and trade function seems to be esoteric to most, but I find 7 Wonders an amazingly elegant, deep and engaging game.

    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">One of my favorite newer strategy games.    For me, the elements of a great strategy game include:   (1) More skill-based than luck-based, (2) Winning strategies change with circumstances, (3) Straightforward / simple set-up,  (4) Balanced gameplay, (5) Does not drag on after one side has a decisive advantage,  (6) Entertaining theme  7 Wonders scores high on all of these attributes.  There is a slight learning curve in 7 Wonders and it might take a round before the rules become clear to new players, but once everyone knows the rules, it's a a simple game that can be played in about 30 - 45 minutes, while also packing in a lot of strategy. </comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="Canada">I really liked this game. Once you know the rules it can be very fast to play.

Thought it considerably better with 3 as there was judgement about which cards would come around again. Very enjoyable. Felt that 7 player was too much of an unknown on the card draws.

I don't normally care for co-op games but this is a great co-op game (with a chance for a betrayer! suspicion lurks everywhere!) with so much flavor it keeps pulling me back.</comment>

    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="Canada">Based on a single play. Lots of fun, great mix of coop and personal goals. The crossroads cards bring a level of thematic immersion which works much better than flavor text ever does. Many memorable moments, such as the time sparky ran up to the woman dying in her crashed helicopter and chose to run off with the gasoline rather than save her.   Ummm. Good dog?  A few plays later... Still great. Love the cross roads cards mechanic. The game is tough, but winning is possible. My only small strike is that the luck can go against you. Just like the lotr lcg (and many other recent games) winning is a combination of good play and the luck of the draw and the dice. Still very fun and very immersive so far.   Probably my game of the year for 2013</comment>
    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">Our first game was pretty exciting!  It feels a bit like BSG, but much more workable with 3-4 players.  I'm holding my rating until after the next game, but I'm hopeful.  Update:  We're a few games in, now, and I'm very comfortable giving this a 9.  It might just be the honeymoon phase, so I hope it sticks it out for the long term!  Update: This has pretty much replaced BSG for my group, if for no other reason than it works with fewer players.</comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">An Outstanding game with very good replay. Only draw back is the learning curve. The Rules Booklet is somewhat difficult to comprehend and it helps to play a game or two with someone that knows the rules. Game strategy can not be enjoyed until game flow is understood. Once game flow is understood than the game's true play value can be realized.</comment>
    <comment game="Orl&#233;ans" game_id="164928" location="United States">This is a really smooth, easy to play Euro system - drawing out characters and playing simultaneously (and yet competing over important aspects). It has a fast race feeling of taking opportunities away from opponents while always building something unique for yourself. The end game scoring is very smooth as well - only resources, coins and a multiplier for guild houses and citizens. Excellent game in every respect. </comment>

We're just getting started with this one!   A surprisingly easy to pick up economic game with a great theme and lots of depth. The wide array of recruitment options gives a sandboxy feel and you can get quite creative with strategies. Later on things get more involved with more demands flying around and people's rosters growing, but it never feels bogged down.   A modern classic, could climb higher.</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">Wow!  What a great game!  It's an interesting exploration of supply/demand.  One unique element is that players must provide or establish both the supply AND the demand.  The tech tree of the employees creates a number of additional strategies and opportunities that interlace with the supply/demand underpinning.  This leads to some complicated interactions and extremely provocative timing considerations since there are inherent delays in most everything (especially the demand side).  One criticism is the play time and that's pretty inherent to the overall engine.  I'd be reluctant to engage in a 5-player enterprise, though one key part of the turn is simultaneous and many other parts are automated (still, players will respond to other's actions, leading to the potential for significant delays).  Another criticism is the components.  Rather low production value for the price, but then it is a Splotter and the game is more than good enough to get over this hurdle.  I have a few longer, heavier games that I absolutely love and it tends to be the game length that is prohibitive in getting them to the table.  I will pick up a copy of Food Chain Magnate and I expect it will fall into this category.  It's an excellent euro that you really should try.</comment>

You need to play it a couple times before you understand why, but once you see the way everything works, and the myriad of paths open to you, the playground it offers is just SO damn perfect and enticing. Seriously great design.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">Excellent heavy game, with a good pace and lots of player interaction.  Unfortunately it's extremely unforgiving so newer players or players who make a tempo-related mistake can simply be eliminated in favor of people who didn't - that said, it's definitely an expected and reasonable feature if you know that's what you're in for.  The theming works really, really well and the graphic design of the cards is fantastic (the board's pretty barebones but it works).</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="Canada">I've played 4 player once and 2 player about 5 times so far. I find that the strategies are totally different, which makes playing with different numbers of people really interesting. Working out how to try and create demand for only one type of good so you can out supply your competitors is definitely difficult and the milestones change up the game a lot. I love the art style, it's beautiful and you can make so many jokes behind the art, little things like the women are the low level cooks and the men are the expert chefs. All the women are HR and all the Men are management, really encapsulates the 50s era.  I would recommend this for people who like resource management games with no chance elements and that have played board games before. This is not an entry level game. I think its best played with 3 or 4 as you essentially have to copy the player in a 2 player game or fall very far behind.  Sidenote: We felt we had to Nerf the Guru in a 2 player or the person who got him would dominate the game every time. We changed him to only be able to upgrade a single person twice but still have 3 possible upgrades.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">An interesting game. Every decision seemed so opaque, it was, without a doubt, the most fraught-filled decision making we have had in a while. A true Splotter classic already, it ranks with their hits, and far surpasses their few misses.</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">This was the game we were waiting for our third player (Sander) to arrive. An incredibly tight, vicious economic game where you can literally be out of contention in the first turn. Placement of restaurants is key. Brian dominated by basically hiring like crazy the first 8 turns or so while Sander and I finished small orders. Brian was then able to steal our customers with his multiple Discounts. So many strategies are forming in my head as I write this. Never place Marketing, let the other players do it. Get the Fridge Milestone. Go for super discounted food. This is the real deal heavy game. Splotter continues its impressive run of gaming (to me at least). Roads &amp; Boats and now this. Indonesia is coming soon, can't wait!!! </comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Canada">A game of 5 rounds where you use dice as an action limiter, and attempt to score the most points in a variety of ways.  The theme of travelling Asia is present but definitely thin, there is significant variability in gameplay due to setup and asymmetric characters, and it has a definite "I want to play again" factor to it (likely due to the relative shortness and variability if gameplay).  The game is for 2-4 players (it scales very well), it lasts 5 rounds, and each round the players roll their personal 5 dice of their player colour.  These will largely dictate what actions they will select with their dice that particular round.  On a players turn, they do one and only one main action but they have the option of doing multiple bonus actions before and/or after their main action.  The actions are: 1) collect money (at best it's 5 gold), 2) go the market, where there are several goods that can be "purchased" (camels, pepper, silk, and gold, listed here in increasing value and difficulty to obtain), 3) earn the favour of the Khan, which is a simpler lower payout version of the market in essence, 4) obtain 1 to 2 new contracts (these are where you will get a lot of your points and are primarily why you need goods from the market), and 5) go travelling, which costs money and is related to the map which also often requires further tolls of camels or money (this is the other main way to score points).  Typically you will want higher dice as higher dice generally give better/stronger actions. There are some instances however, when lower dice are good; whenever a player chooses an action with their dice, other players may still choose this action but they will then have to pay in gold, therefore if you are taking an action late you will get it cheaper with low dice values, also some actions do not benefit from high dice values (earning 5 gold, often the favour of Khan, and sometimes travelling).  As well at the beginning when players roll their dice there is a small gold compensation for very low roll totals (this is very minor however).  The bonus actions are as follows: 1) re-roll a die (thus costs a camel per re-roll), 2) move a due value up or down by one (this costs 2 camels, and unfortunately you cannot wrap around), 3) earn 3 gold (this is unlimited, you do not have to pay for taking it late, but it does use up a precious action die), 4) obtain a bonus black die for the round (this costs 3 camels, and these are both powerful and limited, powerful as it's an extra die and it also allows a lot of placement freedom with the die as you cannot normally place more than one die of the same colour at the same location, but with black die you can).  The majority of points are obtained from: 1) completing contracts which are typically a mix of camels and marketplace goods and which pay out points but also potentially other goods, black die, more contracts, or free movement, and 2) movement on the map of Asia. This is an integral but difficult part of the game, as movement is very costly and the routes you want to take are often mutually exclusive to each other.  When you move into a city, you automatically get to place one of your trading posts in that city and cities come in 2 flavours small and big.  Small cities pay out an income at the start of every round, and big cities provide new die action spaces for those players who reached that city and many of these city actions provide scoring options (there are only a small number of city cards used each round from a large stack in the game box), as well as a small one-time bonus for the first player to reach that city.  You also want to travel as at the start of the game you will secretly select 2 travel cards which pay out end game points for reaching certain cities and for reaching a large number of different cities.  As well, if you can get down all of your trading posts it's worth a bonus 15 end game points and if you can reach the city of Beijing it's worth up to 10 endgame points (and it also allows you to convert left over resources into points which are otherwise worthless).  The most interesting aspect to the game is that each player will get 1 unique player character with a powerful ability and a lot of the fun and replay ability comes in trying out new characters each game.

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Austria">+ The New Characters.  This is an amazing game, that play after play is becoming one of my favorites. First of all the production quality is top notch for a euro-game. The custom wooden components are really nice, the cardboard is thick and sturdy, the artwork is functional but also aesthetically pleasing. Overall the game has just an intriguing look when it's on the table. Going beyond the surface, the mechanisms in the Voyages of Marco Polo may not seem very innovative when taken individually, but the sum of its parts creates instead a very interesting and unique game-play. There's SO much to like in this "mix of mechanisms"!  I like that the board is divided in two sections, where your dice/workers follow different rules. I like the concept of unlocking new actions by traveling on the map. I like the fact that every time - given the enormous amount of cards in the box - those actions can create cool combos that you never saw before. I like this huge variety, that forces you every time to pay attention to those action cards, to the interactions between them and to their position on the board, before you build your strategy. Yet what I like the most about Marco Polo is its overpowered nature, which is also probably the most innovative element of the entire game. It's not just the characters, which are all very different and absolutely powerful, but a lot of the city actions are incredibly strong too!  For this very reason though it's not uncommon to find some mixed opinions about this game. Many people questioning its balance, whether is that particular character or the travel strategy or the contract strategy. Yet, while I can see how some people might get these impressions when one player starts making a ton of points out of some combo, I don't see this as a lack of balance myself instead. After all that's what the game is about for me: the exploitation of the strongest powers in that particular game. Depending on the actions that come out during the set-up and where they come out some strategy might be easier or stronger that the others, but then it's up to the player to find it before someone else at the table does. That's the beauty of Marco Polo!  Overall The Voyages of Marco Polo is an absolutely amazing game with beautiful components, that can offer a great deal of different challenges and re-playability... and I find myself loving it more and more as the time goes by. I highly recommend it to every euro-gamer out there!</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Austria">Excellent game! Enjoyed it much much more than arkham horror. Only downside is that there are only 4 ancient ones included. </comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Australia">Much more enjoyable than I was expecting: a really well thought out reworking of Arkham Horror.  Between them they do a decent job of covering my Big Seven favourite 'Cthulhu' stories. AH invokes the last half of 'The Shadow over Innsmouth' and the back end of 'The Dunwich Horror': stories where investigation is done, and some kind of New England eruption is underway.  EH invokes 'The Call of Cthulhu', 'At the Mountains of Madness', and maybe the back end of 'The Shadow Out of Time': investigation stories that piece stuff together from different places. Neither of them gets across the claustrophobic feel of 'The Whisperer in Darkness' and 'The Haunter of the Dark'. Both have some out of place elements: shopping trips, Christian tropes, etc.  Those tend to pull me up more in AH, but EH isn't without them.  The link to those two great stories is certainly a reason to enjoy AH: I do prefer EH, however, for its own story links - and for its rules, design, mechanics (double sided cards are a great rip from MoM), the strategy/ride balance, the global scope and the distinctive twist each AO brings to it. I had a lot of fun with AH, and now do the same with EH.  Update: raised the score because the expansions I've tried (the small ones) are working out well without bloat issues.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">A notch below Arkham but good fun none-the-less, and quicker playing. I wish there were new characters other than the same Arkham ones, although they're done so well this is a minor complaint.  Feels a lot like Tales of the Arabian Nights as a storytelling engine rather than like Arkham Horror, strangely enough. That is, somewhat random things happen to you and you just roll with it and see what happens.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Canada">Possibly my favourite game. It's a 2-5 hour slugfest, but so intensely fun as a co-operative epic journey to save the world while entropy overtakes you.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Wales">A streamlined alternative to Arkham Horror. I like Arkham Horror but it can drag and the victory conditions always involve collecting Elder Signs. Eldritch horror has different victory conditions for each Ancient One and they very from game to game. One of my favourite solo games. </comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">I'm already heavily invested in Arkham Horror so I won't buy this, but Eldritch Horror is most definitely the better game.  Everything has been tightened up and the theme is much more solid and consistent.</comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">One of my absolute favorite games ever. I will play this under any circumstances. It has completely retired Arkham Horror, which was also one of my absolute favorite games. I understand and agree that player decisions are rarely informed (though they do have an impact) but the game's ability to tell a story and depict a world on the edge of destruction is unparalleled. Writing this is making me want to go play it now.</comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">Exceedingly well designed, tight economy and tough choices in hand management. There are several paths to points and they hinge on taking advantage of opportunity while making your way progressively (and quickly!) across the map. Plays fine with 2, but better with 4 - although a full table of 5 might feel too crowded. Incredibly good game - feels like a classic to me.</comment>

And despite what the rules say you can easily play 2-player on the Empire side of the board without it bogging down the game or making it too easy for anyone. It's a must have in our opinion. There is one thing about this game that baffles me. And it is in other Euros as well. If scoring only occurs at the end of the game, why is there a scoring track on the board? </comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">I had mixed feelings about this game initially as I really struggled to determine how well myself and other players were doing without any in game scoring; however, this is currently one of my heavier games I always suggest to hit the table at this time.</comment>

I didn't really come super close to winning, but I could see the mistakes I made earlier and how I might have been closer!  An all day affair with 8, yet that is really the only way I could really see playing it.  Had an excellent time, and would love to play it again.  With the JO on Mecatol Rex expansion, I'd raise the rating to a 10.  </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">Very good space empire game. Always willing to play and wanting to get people together to play a game. Sometimes I like to use a few variants to try to shorten game time. This monster of a game takes good planning to get to the table, but it is oh so satisfying...  As a long time fan of Master of Orion II and other civilization games and sci-fi games, the theme for this one is perfect for me. It's my "monster game" of choice.  I like this endgame variant: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/358579/an-easy-victory-variant-2nd-edition-style-twilig  but I'm thinking about changing benefits to: stage II: tech cost -1, +1 yield for each trade contract stage III: tech cost -1, +1 fleet supply limit, free tech stage IV: tech cost -2, +1 yield from trade contracts</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Greece">The most epic boardgame out there. Very competitive and a pure wargame in heart. Very different from eclipse in that respect (eclipse is more about management development economy and planning). It leaves a sense of epicness, and glorious memories, as long as it is played by people who appreciate roleplaying, gaming, complicated rules, and can devote 1-2 hours per player. I advise playing with 4 or more players to feel the galactic senate and competition better. 4 player games preserve the games feel, and can take 4 hours with a trained group, something you could pull even weekly with a dedicated group.</comment>

It's really amazing that a game with such long play times and player turns can always remain engaging and interesting. It's a testament to the design that I never feel bored while playing, even if I'm sitting there for five minutes until my next turn. There's always planning to be done, motivations to be determined, techs to research, tactical movements to be laid out, and devious machinations to undertake. It's always a tense and surprising game that always retains the same epic feel, while remaining unpredictable and different every time. </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Romania">It is "THE" empire builder game. It has everything you need to conquer the galaxy. If you are able to allocate free hours to play, than you will build explore the galaxy, colonize, build up armies, research technologies to aid you, make diplomatic and arrangements. It is byfar the most complex 4x game available, very immersive and also very huge, as it needs a large table to play on. It can accomodate up to eight players, but that will result in a very prolonged gameplay. It has lots of expansion modules, which you can combine as they suit you, giving more randomness than usual.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">Every thing about this game is very well made and the rule books seems very well done with lots of examples.  This looks like a gamers game so I might not ever win this game.  I enjoyed my first play and so did my gaming group.  We played with 5 players and my best guess is that playing time is about 4 hours but could be quicker with some players getting ready for their turn while the person in front of them finishes their turn.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">This game is freaking awesome! My wife and I played one game and we both love it. Even with just two players it is a fully enjoyable game, somewhat the way Agricola is.  If you like worker placement this is THE worker placement game, the others are now just filler.  The area control mechanic really sets this one apart from other worker placement games.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Finland">2010/10 After 1st play: At Dominant Species you twist and twist and twist and then do a little tweak and finish with a somersault. There are so many ways to affect the situation on the board that you easily tie your brain into a neat knot.  The heart of the game is pure area control. What makes it more complicated than any other similar game is that each area can be controlled in two different ways. Before scoring there are several phases each turn and every single one of these phases can affect the situation considerably. Therefore, it's really hard to plan ahead.  But still I enjoyed the game more and more as it went longer. The art of the game is functional, but there's no way you could call it beautiful.   2013/01 8-&gt;9 If I just had time, I'd play Dominant Species any time. Unfortunately 3-5 hours is not something you always have at your disposal.   2015-11-04 To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. It seems that nowadays the games hitting the table are action packed sub 90 minute games instead of longer ones like Dominant Species. And the fact that you essentially get the same experience from El Grande but in much simpler and more forgiving format, made the decision easier. I might get the iOS app of Dominant Species, which should make the game run faster since less time will be spent on calculating who's in control and who's dominating each area.   If I only had more space to store my games...</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United Kingdom">Didn't manage to complete my first game but from playing it seems like a very good game. Takes some time to work out all the intricacies and see how the animals behave but this really is a very good game but unfortunately is quite long.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Canada">Great area control/worker placement design, packed with strategy options and nailbiting tactical decisions.  Only the fitest will survive!  A absolute gem!  The only thing that prevent me from giving this game a 10 is its lenght.  Very difficult to get 4-6 players to invest that amount of time on a single game.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="">Favourite at the moment. Tactical, strategical, cutthroat. 2 drawbacks: hard for many to see scoring for opposition (risks of kingmaking)and a bit long.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">Third printing ordered via P500.  We've had a few games now, and I'm confident in giving in a 9 for now.  For as long as the game takes to play, it feels like it plays very fast, which really impresses me.  You're constantly taking small turns and making decisions, and any time you're not is almost certainly filled up with considering your next action.  I get bored very easily during long games with lots of downtime, and I'm very pleased to see that Dominant Species doesn't have this problem.  I've never played a euro with this much direct competition before, and it's awesome!</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United States">I'm not sure if I've played this enough to give it any higher a rating (which probably means I haven't).  Nevertheless I find the gameplay just captivating.  I hope that continues, but I do need to play more.</comment>

All of the small icons on the player cards I find annoying. In contrast I really like this game and to me it very much feels like a race. Curiously I've only ever played it 2 player (8 games so far) and I think it works very well with this number. Here's hoping for some expansions! In short, highly recommended!</comment>

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">LOVE THIS!!!  It's Race, but with dice!  So well done.  So much fun.  It's Race, but it doesn't *feel* like card Race, and that's okay.  Because it's awesome!</comment>
    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="">It's great to get a back full of colorful dice.  It's one of the more complicated games I play, but I like that about it.  It's not so complicated for my dad though.  It's definitely easier than Race for the Galaxy because in this game, the symbols are accompanied by text that explain everything.</comment>

    <comment game="Roll for the Galaxy" game_id="132531" location="United States">NOTE: I have never played Race for the Galaxy... but I don't care! This is just an awesome dice game. The design is so mature. You never really get shafted with any rolls since you can mitigate the results and reassign symbols with lots of abilities.  There are a ton of viable and competitive paths to victory, and I've lost several games that were still so satisfying simply because I built an effective engine. The depth of starting tiles, developments, and dice worlds make for lots and lots of variable games.   The learning curve is steep for some people I've introduced to the game, but I have yet to meet anyone who did not take to it with enthusiasm and competence after a few games. I am impressed, game after game, given how much depth, strategy, and prediction are packed into something as short as thirty or forty minutes.</comment>

    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Canada">(bought 2nd hand)</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Italy">Excellent. Broad horizon of options built on a simple, really elegant system. Deeply interactive, victory must be pursued round by round, optimizing your long period resources (caballeros for area control and power cards for turn order selection) with the tactical dilemmas offered by the shared action cards. Due to the random extraction of the action cards, every round can bring unexpected twists to the game, but nothing can beat a good tactical (and strategic, to some extent) play. Furthermore, I was surprised by its accessibility: I've had the opportunity to play El Grande with some non-gamers and they really appreciated the game, since their first play.  Shake and serve to 3 people or more (with 2 the game can be dry, not nearly as good as in 4 or 5).  Hans im Gl&#252;ck (German) version. Neat and solid euro components. Minor complaints: the score track on the board is without numbers (only in the HiG version, as far as I know), the iconography on the cards is a bit less intuitive than I expected: it will usually take more than one game to completely forget about the text, be it right on the cards or on a handy translation. </comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United Kingdom">The beauty of this game is that the rules and mechanics are fairly simple.  Its the cards that make your brain burn nearly every turn - this means that those who want to think deeply can (and will probably blow the opposition away) and those who want light can just pick a card on a fairly ill-considered basis and still know what is going on in the game.  Some of the cards are great in that they cause the complexion of the board to change completely.  Upped rating from 8 to 9.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="">Awesome! Easy rules. Huge amount of options. Very tactical. Excellent interaction. I like!</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Canada">The definitive area control game.  It's all about getting majorities in Spanish provinces, or at least scoring some second-place points where you can.  Some great original ideas here, including the use of power cards to determine play order, face up action cards to execute your actions (OK so that's not too original), and the secret disc/Castillo used to plan for sneak attacks.  There's a tradeoff with every decision- play too high a power card, and you don't get to import many caballeros (cubes), plus you're likely to have to play your power card last next round, select a powerful action card, and you don't get to place many caballeros, put too many caballeros into the Castillo, and it's overkill.  Plays 2-5, but I find it to be better with 4-5.  Long-range strategy can be difficult, as this game is very tactical, but it is definitely a strategic game.  One of the best Euro games ever, and a must for any gamer.  Own the El Grande expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Excellent condition. Willing to trade. Big Box ed has arrived.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Australia">Seminal area control game. Very replayable even without the expansions. Despite the guidelines on the side of the box, not to be taken with less than 4 players, and preferably with 5.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="">A game from the golden age of Euros.  El Grande is a multi-player conflict game where you can't kill your opponents' dudes.  At best you can outnumber them at the right time.  Yet they persists, those voiceless masses, not so patiently waiting for their day in the sun.  The Castillo is a lot of fun, trying to remember what's in there while competing for position on the board.  An almost perfect game with great pacing.</comment>
    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Australia">Probably one of my favorite Euros for its in your face appeal. Upped it from 8-&gt;9 after 2 more plays, easily my favorite euro, and the best of the 'area control' I have played.  </comment>

    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United States">Smooth-playing, tense, and exciting, with just the right amount of randomness as well as several clever game mechanics. This isn't a game where you build a strong position from the start; you have to be willing to drop your previous plans and think up a new one at a moment's notice. Not to say that there isn't some level of strategic planning, but you have to be willing to squeeze the most out of every turn to really get the most out of this game. There's a lot to like here; El Grande is a deserved classic of boardgaming, though I imagine it's probably a bit dry for some people. </comment>

    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="United Kingdom">I think this is going to be one of my favourites as I play it more and more.  I was very impressed with its depth and elegance.  There are lots of things to think about and the mechanics are well integrated.    It reminded me of San Marco in many respects - the area control and mess-up-you-neighbour mechanisms are similar and some of the cards do the same sorts of things. Having said that, San Marco is a much quicker game with less, though still significant depth, but possibly slightly more elegance (it's simpler and works with less big shifts).  Which is preferable may come down to the number of players available at the time. </comment>

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">This expansion is more like "Dominion: Round Two."  The new cards are *extremely* nice.  Possibly overpowering in a few respects, but they shore up some of the weaknesses in the base game.  I like how they mix up the gameplay and change things.  The combo cards (VP + something else) are very nice, while the new attack cards are just mean!  Best effect likely obtained by mixing this with the first/base game.  Still not deep or strategic enough for me to rate a 10.  Can be pretty random and unforgiving.  Some of the cards in this expansion flat out improve on cards in the base set with the most notable one being the Ironworks vs. the Workshop.  Why would I bother with the Workshop ever again?  The expansion totally outmodes some base cards and that doesn't strike me as a good thing nor as a good game model.  An excellent game that is well worth playing.  I like this one better than the base game.  Improves on it in almost every respect.  People new to this "series" should probably start with the base game as it is simpler and, more likely, easier to follow.  For those of us experienced with the base game, this expansion simply rocks!</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="Spain">Slightly more complex than the original Dominion. The biggest difference is the presence of more cards with double function (Victory/Action, Victory/Tresor, etc) and the presence, in general, of more text in the cards. I was initially skeptical and preferred Dominion cards, but once I got used to the Intrigue cards, I think that they offer more variety.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">My favorite Bruno Cathala game so far. Five Tribes is a mechanism cocktail but most notably the area control and mancala mechanics are the big gears that move the game. Yes there is card drafting set collection djinns with triggering powers etc etc but those are all added meat on a solid game design that make a good game better. I really enjoy this game. You spend most of it dropping five different meeples mancala style on each module of the board. The last drop triggers one of five different possible powers and possibly gets you ownership of the module, you obtain land, djinns and special sets of cards to gain victory points and win the game. As play progresses and available moves diminish ap can creep in to the game and slow it down but this is a minor issue. The art is also gorgeous. I am jot surprised that the game is getting so much recognition and accolades. Also, if feeding old people and slaves to djinns to make them use powers isn't your thing, the BGG store is currently selling substitute cards to swap out the slaves for.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="">From the way you manipulate the meeples, move them on the board to being about to go with so many different strategies to win, everything is so well integrated. Genie powers, market place purchases, auctioning for first place, managing tiles, everything is just excellent! </comment>

It's a game of opportunity and there is not one single strategy that will alwys win. It's your way to adapt and to go for the best deal/opportunity that will make you win. I would put a 10 but my gaming group sometmes play so slowly that it takes more time than it should ... :)</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Brazil">Great game, I read a lot of people complaining about the AP, I played the game in 4, with 2 friends that are known by their apness and simply the game passed the test. We managed to play this game in about 50 minutes. Very interesting game, good mechanics, simple, with enough depth. The art is amazing, like almost every art from Days of Wonder.  Edit: After a game in 2 players I decided to give it a push forward on the rating. Great game in 2 players, plays a little different, you can make powerful combos that make the game even more interesting.  Edit: It is a 9 rate, great game, very different strategies and variability of gameplays, a lot of interaction, after a couple more games I can say it works fine in 2, 3 or 4, probably one of the best games of this year.

    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="Romania">FAVOURITE GAME - An excellent tactical ship-to-ship combat game based on the Star Wars universe. You either choose to play with the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire. The gameplay is quite easy: you secretly plan you moves and then execute them together with any special actions available. The combat is more or less a question of luck, as you roll dice, although having some option to modify the results. The starter set does not confer an epic feel to the game, but if you choose to upgrade your fleet by buying units it becomes awesome.</comment>

It has dice, but it's a game about the builds you put together and how well you can predict and position your own ships against your foe.</comment>

It's very easy to explain and get playing fast, it's very thematic and is full of great moments, it's incredibly customizable, the models are pre-painted and look great. I'll be holding onto this game for many many years and even if I never bought anything else for it I could play it for long time to come. </comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">So fun! Simple to learn, involves some anticipating when building strategy but not enough that it feels overwhelming. The beginning and ending rounds of the game are pivotal and completely unpredictable, yet risks are reliably rewarded throughout. If there was a way to play solo, I'd buy this one. </comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">This game would be a 10 for me if it weren't for the box design. It just really bothers me that the base doesn't fit into the lid when it's open.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">This is an amazingly fun game. Its a euro style worker placement game that has become a hit with my wife and my gaming buddies. Really glad I picked this one up.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">A classic worker placement game with everything done just how a worker placement should be. I don't think anything in this game excels but it is done just right. Rules are simple and accessible to people as well making this game easy to bring to the table. I have yet to find anyone that does not like this game. </comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Well done euro game.  After two plays with four players this game is a top 50 euro.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Portugal">Very good game. Love the quests and the buildings... I only wish it came with meeples instead of cubes!</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United Kingdom">For what it is, that is to say a readily accessible eurogame with flavourful theming, it is astonishing. The production quality is to the standard one would expect of a Hasbro subsidiary with such a history, and the game even develops positively as an experience with the inclusion of the expansion (an enviable quality most designers cannot match).   As such it is an excellent gateway game, but one that harbours replayability. </comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">Scoundrels boosts it to 10. </comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="England">Played this three times now and it's a really good game, pretty much everything I hoped Ankh Morpork by Martin Wallace would be. A very pleasant game with solid euro mechanisms and rules that are fully understood by the end of round one. Enough theme and flavour to give the game a slight D&amp;D feel, although meeples instead of cubes for the adventurers would have been a nice touch to support the imagination if you're that way inclined. As for me I'm perfectly happy to be collecting cubes! Overall, strongly recommended, and I've just acquired a copy.  This is a contender for one of the best eurogames of 2012 imo.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Malaysia">Played this first on iPad and love the gameplay so bought the physical copy. Can't wait to play it more often</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">My wife's favorite game.  We haven't played it a ton lately, but every time it's her turn to pick, Lords of Waterdeep is on the table.  And you know what?  That doesn't make me sad.  NOTE: We have upgraded our version with the excellent dndeeples.  If you're on the fence about upgrading, DO IT.  They add so much to the theme of the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="United States">This is truly one outstanding game. There is a lot of variety and the game scales magnificently with more or less players. The number of options avaliable to the players are perfectly matched with the number of workers given per game and the "Take That!" mechanics aren't friendship-ruining. A competitive game that isn't so fierce as to ward off new players.</comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">I have not really liked a single adventure board game before this one. They all just seem to fall flat, even when the mechanics seem strong. But MoM 2e has exceeded my expectations. I hate apps in board games, but dangit! The app works so well. It makes the adventure and mystery work so much. It's just a bunch of fun.   There are definitely some flaws in the execution. But the game is so unique and interesting besides them, it's hard not to enjoy it regardless.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">A "next level" design, for sure. The game was a tad long for my tastes, but therein is the beauty of the save feature in the app.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">Okay - this one is huge on BGG right now and moving up the ranks quick. I was super excited about and couldn't wait to get it to the table. Granted I am still in the glow that results after the first play of something I liked but this game fired on all cylinders for me. We hooked up a blue tooth speaker on the table for ambiance and my wife and I adventured away. We actually lost the first scenario as wife's investigator went insane right at the end. Can't wait to play again. </comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="New Zealand">A perfect blend of board game and video game.

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United Kingdom">Excellent game with sensible integration of app to act as game master. At the price point I hope they will extend the scenarios in future updates to the app so that this title will remain fresh to owners. I think this is the only concern that stops this game from currently rating a 10 for me.</comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Greece">The main issue with the initial game was the long set-up (and the fact that the "DM" was enjoying less than the investigators).  This is finished with the APP feature. My first game with an APP, I think I will look out for more!!!  Get it!   It worth its money!</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="Netherlands">Great game! We had a blast in our first play (and lost) :-D Hope it will stay up and is very replayable.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">Initial Impressions: ------------------------- Best use of an app in a boardgame yet.  The app simply creates an experience not possible by a boardgame, and it is an amazing experience.  If this game gets supported (which it will), i only see it getting better and better.  I hadn't found a "Haunted Mansion" type game that I really enjoyed, and this is it... with flying colors.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">Amazing single player game when you want. Even better with friends. Love the app and all it does. So much fun.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United Kingdom">Liked first edition apart from the setup (too easy to goof up) and that it really needed at least 4 players. All fixed with this version :) great even solo. Plus you can reuse most of the first edition stuff.  Not perfect though. Insane cards are a bit too random, figures could be better, bases are just stupidly big (storage is a headache), needs more scenarios.  Nice change of pace from Eldritch Horror.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="">With the app connected to a Bluetooth speaker, the atmosphere, sound effects were excellent. The miniatures could be a little better, however I don't actually mind them. I will need to glue them to the bases, and then all will be good. I really enjoy the use of the app in gradually revealing the mansion rooms as well as keeping track of the puzzles. I thoroughly enjoy this game!</comment>

Has immense replay value especially with the expansions (you can add just the modules you like). With the expansion you can adjust the game according to the evolution of your group's game play skills.  Get Daybreak for 4-player games, the Cylon Leader Motives really make very interesting games. </comment>

    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Australia">Awesome. The best co-op with screw-up (traitor) on the market. You don't need to know the TV series, but it is hugely better if you do.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Germany">Painted - Good translation of the TV-Series into a boardgame. The traitor and the game mechanics can really make you feel like in the series.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">This is a great game but without the expansions the vagaries of shuffling can make the game swingy. With the Cylon Fleet option and Personal Goals from exodus, The Pegasus from the Pegasus expansion and the mutiny, motive and treachery decks from Daybreak this hits 10.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">The three-pronged approach for determining the Cylon is amazing: 1) The handful of cards and abilities that let you look at someone's loyalty card (Hard, Rare Knowledge) 2) The statistical games you can play with who contributed or didn't contribute various cards to Crises (Less Hard, Frequent Knowledge) 3) Reading people, probing them with questions, and interpreting their reactions (Soft, Constant Knowledge)  There's so much interplay with those three strategies, and they brilliantly culminate in a 15 minute shouting fest about whether or not Uncle Dan is a frakking cylon (spoiler: he is!).  I'm not aware of a better hidden-traitor game. </comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">The best of the cooperative/competitive games on the market IMHO. The dynamics are interesting, the uncertainty of which side you'll be on eventually keeps the suspense, and the theme is great. The characters play differently and the pacing of lulls vs. action sequences works well too.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Netherlands">One of the best games in the market. Very well balanced, tense, paranoia-making game. It has action, politics, LOADS of theme, everything. Most of the sessions are memorable, and not many games can create this. I can never turn down a game of BSG. </comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United States">The fun in this game is very dependent on the group.  If you have a boring group that will not throw our "You must be a frakking toaster" every so often, it will not be a fun game.  The fun is the meta game.  I have never seen an episode of BSG, and I still like this game.  On of the few games where someone has called another person in our group an 'idiot'.</comment>

    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="United Kingdom">Is this the best political game of all? Its hard to tell in really heavy combat, but I'd back it against Rep of Rome. Easily FFG's best in-house design and very nearly their best product ever. Top-quality design. A very fine TV-series-to-boardgame conversion that invites a long hard look at the revered but aged Dune. A genuine co-op game for the co-operators, given that a large proportion of the players ally with the game to beat them. It begins to capture the underlying subtly and sophistication of the power-politics situation as portrayed on TV...as well as everything else, which is remarkable in a game as simple as this. "Whats not to like" is a good question. Cylon rules are questionable. Requires decent gamers [and its interesting how many commentators mention this]. And no Tricia Helfer, not even in delusional form for a cylonic Baltar. Unfair to compare to Shadows as its far too good for that.</comment>

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="Lithuania">Great two player experience. Many paths to victory, cool seasons change implementation and tool development. This is a must-have game for Uwe Rosenberg fans.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United Kingdom">Follows a familiar Uwe Rosenberg formula, with just enough tweaks to make it different from Cavricola. It's a little more of a sandbox, and a little more detailed thanks to the focus on two players. Ideal way to spend a few hours with a significant other.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">A wonderful game by Uwe Rosenberg, honing and perfecting many of the mechanics he used on his prior games like Agricola and Caverna, for that smaller player count. The mechanisms are simple, but there are many you can use, and you get that familiar, tactile sensation of clearing your lands of moors, moving dikes to hold back the tidal flat, buying and mating animals, and using a wide array of actions to buy buildings, increase the number of tools you can use, or even travel to local rustic destinations to trade. The theme can't be beat, it's the most personal for the designer yet, and it has just this amazing, humble, pastoral feel to it. I think it is his best game, yet, with the caveat that it only plays 1-2.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">On the surface, Fields of Arle is a daunting game to play; there are 30 different actions in the game and not much to direct/limit you. For this reason, the game can be a bit befuddling to play and come across as non-confrontational. And truth be told, after my first play, I felt the game was more of a solitaire experience than a tense worker-placement game (e.g. Agricola). But through playing more games, I learned to value the actions and predict what my opponent was doing. Suddenly the game felt more like race to certain actions/builders, which created a healthy amount of tension.  More importantly, this is a game with tons of interesting decisions. While the lack of randomization may seem to limit the replayability of the game, the game manages to create a plethora of useful strategies. And because of the indirect player confrontation, the game also manages to be quite tactical. The end result is a game that encourages players to plan their turns out far ahead but one that feels quite different each game as players react tactically to their opponent's moves. Nothing about this game plays itself or seems obvious... it's the type of game that you continue to think about after finishing.  If you are a euro-gamer and a fan of point-salad/optimization games... you need to take a close look at this title. It's remarkably good. </comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="Greece">Well, yes, it resembles other Uwe's agricola-clones, but it has the benefit of almost nonexistent round setup. It also has a steep learning curve since even experienced Uwe fans will find it confusing at the first play. Best feature is the action that lets you permanently boost your other actions.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United Kingdom">A truly excellent worker placement game with many avenues of strategy to explore and to build up as you wish. Every game has been a joy and a great two and one player experience.</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">It may be Uwe's best game, certainly his best game for 2p. Lots of AP in the beginning, but by the 5th turn your end game starts to take shape and it's a sprint to the finish. Can't wait to play it some more.</comment>

Unlike other board games it is quick and easy to set up and play, so we have played it a lot more than many other games already.  In fact we played it almost every evening in the first week we got - testament to its addictiveness.  Also, it is one of the first games that I have been considering buying add-ons for.  Highly recommended!</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Contrarians dismiss this game though still one of the best deck-builders out there. No theme most of them say. I say so what? Theme does not a game make. Most don't have it. Most of those don't need it. This is one of those. I have all the expansions and haven't begun to tap the myriad possibilities that entails. I never mixed more than two sets yet.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Hong Kong">Alone I rated it 8 but raised to 9 after the release (and numerous plays) of Seaside.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">I have a blast playing this game, and the gf doesn't hate it! Dominion is easy to teach and quick moving, which makes it ideal for casually deciding to play a game. I appreciate the card variety, which can make every game a different experience. That said, at a point you starting learning strategies and which cards are more OP, so the game can become less of a new challenge. I still love this game, but for that reason I'll definitely be looking to the expansions next.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">I like this. Quick action with a deck-building/card buying mechanism. I can see why it's popular. </comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Finland">Dominion as a whole is probably the best card game I've played, but only with at least one of the expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Finland">Simply a brilliant deck-building game. Fast to play, easy to learn, difficult to master. It just works.  Nov. 2011 - I've been working on an in-depth review and ended up knocking it down a notch from 9.5 to 9. I still think it's a brilliant game, obviously.. just not quite a "10".</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">(Please note my updates, modified over time and experience with this title).  INITIAL IMPRESSION: I don't yet fully appreciate the allure of deck-building... I continue to keep trying though, as there is something I must be missing. This will certainly stay on the shelf and I have every confidence the mystery will reveal itself to me.  UPDATE: I have no confidence that the mystery will reveal itself. None. I simply don't get it. To me, this seems as if it's a slot machine played with cards. Dominion obviously needs a home that has more love than I'm capable of giving it... thus it's traded (something I rarely do).  SECOND UPDATE: After taking an even longer break from this game, I repurchased it and I find I'm actually liking it. :) While it won't be my favorite game, it's unlike my past impressions a great deal -- much more favorable. This and the series are keepers for me now, I'm happy to say. I've always WANTED to like it, and now I can say that I do.  THIRD UPDATE: This is awesome. I'll play it whenever anyone wants to do so. The kids even like it. Win all around.</comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">This has become my favorite worker placement game and one of my favorite games overall. The skill/luck balance is perfect. The components and art are top notch. And not only is the theme something I like but it's wonderfully integrated into the game itself. This rating includes the Tuscany expansion elements as well such as the bigger board, structures, and special workers. The "base" game would be an 8.5.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="Romania">A great game that bumped its way into my top ten after only one play. A great mix of card play, combos, worker placement and a "race game". Love the theme, also. </comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="">I love how well balanced this game is. If you're behind in a certain strategy to obtain points, there's always another way. It's pretty punishing if you're not efficient with your moves though. Highly recommend if you're looking for a worker placement game.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="Germany">Worker placement at its best. And I am not too much a fan of this type. But this game really shows how much work you have to finally drink a glas of wine. A lot of ideas and a lot of options, specially the cards in summer and winter allow for big changes in the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="Australia">Just a lovely game, with an excellent theme. Highly enjoyable and I feel like I get better at it each time I play it.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">Well designed Euro. Lots of moving parts, but streamlined gameplay once you get the basics. Lots of choices and paths to victory. Plays well solo with the built in solo rules. Great game.</comment>

She find this game relaxing and really enjoy playing it, and thus she often ask to play it. ++ Great component, and the Essential Edition really put together the best smaller modules of Tuscany to get a streamlined experience. ++ Great value, not only because the Essential Edition retail for the same price as the older 2nd Edition, but also because you have a lot of quality components for the price. ++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (even with the Tuscany EE expansion in the box!). ++ Most negative points about Viticulture I had (and many other had) have been addressed with the release of the 2nd Edition and now with Viticulture Essential Edition. ++ There are expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it). ++ The Moor Visitors expansion add new visitors with more unique abilities which really refresh the game.  ++ The Tuscany Essential Edition expansion, streamlined all the remaining expansion modules of the initial Tuscany expansion, to just the best one in my opinion, for a great low price. ++ TEE is a must have expansion for anyone that want to bring VEE to another level, strategy-wise and gameplay-wise (It is not a "Must Have" in the sense that it is needed as VEE by itself is a great game though). ++ The new board now feature 4 seasons with worker placement spots (with bonuses at the 2-player count!), and also an extended player order chart that I really love with bonuses at each season (I also really like the new implementation of the player order track where the first to choose next year is the first to pass) All these changes increase the depth, strategy and the replayability of the game. ++ It adds the structure cards, which I love as it give a unique feel to each game, that also add to the possible strategies/path of victory and again add more replayability. ++ It also adds the special workers which make the game a bit more strategic and variable from game to game, because these special workers enable some cool new stuff that were not possible before that, which again adds more replayability. ++ I really like this kind of expansions made by modules which you can play with or without any modules easily ( so you can scale Viticulture from an accessible medium weight game to a much more meatier game).   :thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]  -- With just VEE, A bit more luck-driven than I love, but still not that bad (but with the experience, players will adjust and mitigate "bad" card draw, especially with the new "trade 1 for 1" action space on the Tuscany board). -- I would have really like to have some action space bonuses available in a 2-player game on the base board, as this extra incentive is kind of missing at that player count. -- The Moor Visitor expansion is expansive for what it is (just 40 more cards in a box), especially when you compare it to the Tuscany Essential Edition expansion that really add a lot of gameplay component for a really great price. -- The Tuscany Essential Edition (if we add every modules included) adds more complexity and more choices which slow down the flow/speed of the game and make the games last longer (but we can still add more or less modules according to the playtime we wish, which is great). -- With the extended board and the extended player boards (with the structure board), it take a lot of table space, so it's hard to play this game beyond 4 players on a normal kitchen table.   :arrowE: [b]OTHER GAME INFO:[/b] [b] Game Weight = 3.03.2/5 Release Date = 2015 (Original release in 2013) Number of Player = 1-6 2-player length (Base game only) = 45-60 min. 2-player length (With expansions) = 60-75 min.

    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">My favorite worker placement game. Such an elegant design where everything you do just makes sense thematically. Rules are simple enough for that I can play with my wife or other non-gamers, but it has enough depth to satisfy Euro enthusiats. Love the mamas and papas for variable player set-ups and the components and artowrk are just fantastic. Cannot recommend this game enough.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="Thailand">Beautiful and engaging game. strong theme. The game play is very rewarding and fun.   </comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">Only two plays in and I feel comfortable giving a rating. This is a very fun game and is a hit right away. The mechanics are easy to grasp--after one read of the rulebook we were off and running and only a couple of references back since then. It's a really tight worker placement, and the very limited resources is what makes it both fun and challenging.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">(No spoilers)  I was so excited to see the Legacy system applied to a game that isn't Risk, and it's every bit as awesome as I'd hoped.  I don't yet know if there's replay value after the main sequence is complete, but after what just happened in our most recent game, I don't even care.  Pandemic Legacy has already given me tension, excitement, joy, and shock that I've never felt in another game, and I'm bumping it up from 9 to 10 as a result.  This is my third 10 ranking ever.  Update:  We've finished our season 1 play-through, and I'm very confident in my 10 rating.  I don't expect to keep playing this copy, but it was so much fun that I'm okay with that.  I recommend this game to everyone, and I'll buy season 2 without a second thought.</comment>

    <comment game="Pandemic Legacy: Season 1" game_id="161936" location="United States">Pandemic is one of the best cooperative games, and the legacy version is much better.  The legacy format synergizes so well with the co-op aspect; your play group will bond as you work through the changes on the board and repeatedly experience the thrill of opening new boxes of components/rules.  If the last few months of play are a bit less exciting (they repeat a mechanic that gets a bit boring) than the first half of the game, it's only because those first six months are about as great a game experience as you can have. </comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">I believe this is a perfect game. It accomplishes what it sets out to do, and does it in a perfectly satisfying and fun way. For having no map, it somehow completely delivers the same feeling that Sid Meier's Civilization (VG) does. It's odd to think that such a "dry" theme, with abstract boards and cards would have such a strong thematic feel to it, but Through the Ages pulls it off admirably. I really love this game. It's not my favorite game, but I have zero complaints about it and see it as always engaging.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Italy">Lungo, a volte lunghissimo, senza la scenografica composizione di un territorio da esplorare, conquistare e sfruttare per progredire al meglio e con un (doppio) regolamento che spaventa i pi&#249;.  Meglio girarne al largo quindi? Macch&#232;!  Un 10 pieno per questo gioco che, personalmente, mi ha fatto sentire pi&#249; di ogni altro provato, sul tema, quel senso di crescita e sviluppo della propria civilt&#224; attraverso un meccanismo molto semplice, nelle regole, quanto complesso e gratificante, nel saperlo gestire. E' fondamentalmente un gioco di carte (che scorrono su un display comune), con una profondit&#224; incredibile e una variet&#224; di scelte che permette sviluppi sempre differenti.  Questa &#232; la mia scelta per un gioco di civilizzazione corposo, altrimenti un perfetto "concentrato" sul tema &#232; The Golden Ages di Luigi Ferrini.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Sweden">My favourite board game of all time. No other game have me captivated like this one. I always feel involved when I play it, which is impressive bearing in mind that the game have such a long playtime. Always looking forward to the next session of this epic brain burner.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">The previous TTA was a 9, excellent Civ builder, and a game I will play almost any time. The only strikes against it were the randomish military draw/balance and the length. Length in and of itself was not a mark against the game, just limited how often I could play it.  This version streamlines some of the length issues, and addresses and rebalances a bunch of other things, based on data from lots and lots of plays. The changes to how military is handled are subtle but genious. As a result, the only reason I wouldn't play this game is if I don't have the time at that session. Flawless game.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Brazil">Guys, I love the original TTA, but this one got even better. The military aspect of the original game played a huge role on the game, that's why I rated it a 9, but it is really fixed on the new TTA. Sure the military path has it's reward, but it is more difficult to play an aggression or a war, and there is no more holy war, the devastating card that can put an entire well developed civilization on the stone age again.  All the changes I've seem are better than the original game, the cards are more attractive, even the usually skipped theocracy is now a good card to pick. The changes in rule are for better for sure. It is a genuine 10, one of my favorite games of all time even better.  Almost forgot, the art of this version is much much better from the original TTA.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="">Very beautiful game, I cannot find the words for explaining myself, but excellent is OK.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">Took a great game and make balance upgrades to it, rules upgrades regarding combat and corruption, and made more of the leaders viable.

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">A beautiful game, and I love the new tactics rule. I need to play this more to see how the other new rules play out; I'm hoping Vlaada hasn't balanced out the fun.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Canada">Changes between second and this third edition are all very welcome. Replacing the discs for cubes is wonderful just in itself. Larger cards, better artwork, slight rules changes, and an easier to manage blue bank (particularly at the end of a turn) are all fantastic. Long and dry but a great civilization game that I love.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="United States">12/10/16: Still a classic.  Somewhat improved, but I still lose horribly at this.  Don't buy the older edition unless it's a lot cheaper.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="">Was my favorite game I'd ever played before the rebalancing. Update to corruption, hero balancing, and tactics sharing had made what I thought was the perfect game better. Balancing food, resources, population, Science, tech, military, culture, and happiness gives me a ton to think about and many paths to victory. Every year, I wish for an expansion to this game. The revision will do.</comment>

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Poland">I've been absolutely blown away with this game. It's deep, strategic and makes me feel that the choices I make matter (this is most apparent after a mistake is made that takes ages to recover, if ever).   The rules make thematic sense and it actually is not so difficult to learn the game (especially thanks to Paul Grogan's videos). The real depth of the game is in choices you have to make to be successful.  The game seemed long at the beginning, but a 2-player game against my girlfriend takes us about 2-hours, which is definitely reasonable (we had games of Kingsburg that took longer and I wouldn't call that a long game for sure).  The sweet spot for this game would probably be with 3 and I would strongly recommend it with 2. I played it once with 4 players and to my mind there's too much downtime that way.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="Sweden">the 2 player game is improved!</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization" game_id="182028" location="">Easily the best game that I've played, and has so much replaybility built into it. I've introduced quite a few friends to it and like me, they have become hooked on this. Can't wait for the expansion cards and iPad version from CGE in 2017!   Currently am playing it multiple times with mates online. Highly recommended if you are into strategy/civilization type, deep thinking game. Only (minor) downside is the steep learning curve, but once you learnt how to play, you will find it hard to stop playing.</comment>

Building up your civilization is a unique experience each time.  And unlike most civilization games, it isn't primarily about combat.  Nevertheless, it is unwise to ignore military.  The new card art is fantastic and a massive improvement over the original.  In addition, every change they made to gameplay is an improvement.  </comment>

The feeling about Cold War is damn good as well implemented as the interweaving of the game mechanics. The monument of the "Twilight Struggle" should stand next to the "Junta" of.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">Great 2-player CDG.  Dripping with theme and history, extremely tense throughout.  Deluxe edition has great production quality.  Only complaints are that dice-rolls can be brutal, and because all enemy events trigger when played for Ops, card draw can screw you.  But overall a fantastic game.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United Kingdom">My favourite two player game.  I must have played it 70-80 times now and it's different every time; but always a challenge.  </comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">A game I really enjoy that I never get to play enough.  It isn't overly difficult to teach, but I have learned that it is off-putting to people when they make plays but you have cards that can undo everything they just did.  Not knowing what is in the card decks is a hurdle for new players.  If you have someone that you can play this with repeatedly it becomes such a great game.  Now with the release of 1989 Twilight Struggle is seeing less play.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United States">I like how Cold War dynamics emerge naturally from the rule set -- fighting over battleground countries, trying and failing to hold onto unstable countries, wondering why your opponent is so interested in Nicaragua, etc. Very tense, too stressful at times, but still lots of fun. </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="United Kingdom">Just wow - ridiculously tense game about the Cold War that matches the theme with the game superbly. Everyone must play this game at least once. The feeling that you get when you NEED to succeed in a space race roll so that you can dump ANOTHER card on the space race in the same turn via the bonus so that a war is avoided is just memorable. The fact that the gf is part Russian only adds to the allure.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="Italy">Played once with Russians: lost Played again but with the Americans: won. Isn't it kinda funny?  Apart from this, I really love it.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="England">Once we had a few proper games under our belts this established itself as a firm favourite, with the mechanics well suited to the ebb and flow of the cold war. I particularly liked the way in which countries with low stability numbers are prone to coup attempts, and the judicious use of realignment rolls makes these very powerful at the right time.  Provided you know the deck and some of the nasties hidden in there, it's an outstanding game. Really top-notch. </comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Struggle" game_id="12333" location="Finland">2008 Twilight Struggle offers a great number of tactical choices every turn. At the same time, there's room for a long term strategy also. TS has a steep learning curve due to the numerous events on the cards.  Although, I'm not a big fan of area control games, here the interesting theme and the depth of the game keeps me playing.  2009  After 6 played games: After learning the cards and really getting into the game, I've raised my rating first from 7 -&gt; 8, and now from 8 -&gt; 9.  2010-03 9 -&gt; 10 I just don't seem to get enough of this game. I love the theme and the strategic and tactical choices the game offers. I admit that there's some room for criticism but still TS is a 10 for me.  2016-11-23 Twilight Struggle has remained my absolute favourite for years now. This is actually a small wonder considering my background that years back I did not fancy confrontational area control games. The frustration caused by someone smashing your carefully built sand castle was too much for me. Moreover, the fact that a single die roll could have such devastating consequences was enough to label TS as a game of pure luck.   However, I kept playing to give the game a chance, and more importantly I kept losing. This convinced me that a game of TS could not be decided by luck alone. There was no way that I would always lose by such a big margin if I was not doing something wrong. So, I became aware how the game is played on two levels, short and long term. In the short term it's all about crisis management and your goal is always in mere survival or delivering the decisive strike. But at the same time you must consider the trade-offs your actions bring you in longer term. Personally I find this trade-off between immediate gain and future benefits the greatest aspects of the game. Usually there are no obvious answers to your problems and it all really depends on what strategy you have chosen.  The Deluxe Version I have in my shelf is absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful art and good quality cardboard make the game a joy. The older editions with the flimsy board and tokens were a bit of pain in the ass to handle, to be honest. You also learn a bit of history while playing the game which is always a major bonus.  If there is something to criticise the game about, it would be the learning curve. There are numerous death traps in the game and losing because of a "stupid" mistake may be bad for the morale. You just have to toughen up and be ready to get smitten before you can walk with confidence.  I have also written a more thorough review of the game here: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/636219/maturing-review-twilight-struggle-after-20-plays  </comment>

You really feel like you are influencing nations, propping up dictators and sponsoring coups in a global political struggle.  The cards are highly thematic, and although some are a bit too specific for my tastes (e.g. cards like Castro, Nasser, etc should be more generic for use in other countries) the game is really set in its place and time.</comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="Denmark">So sad that I only have 2 games under my belt so far. I imagine it will surpass Castles of Burgundy as my favorite.  just played our 3rd game, and the first time we did not play with the recommended setup. Wow. We were 3 players.  1 played the engineers, because last time he was screwed with bridges and this time he wanted to build them when he wanted to. Was majorly screwed by starting positions (he himself was to blame), so he lost. I was swarmlings, and played alright I thought. My wife was the green ones that is not witches, and won by far.  We started fairly far away from eachother, so we minded our own business. This also led Wife to win.  I LOVE this game.  Eventhough you don't win, you still get to build something.</comment>
    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="United Kingdom">The heaviest game I own, in both weight and play experience. The first play through and set-up might be daunting, but persist and you will find a beautiful, challenging experience that rewards your initial fear. Once you've played it once, the set up is easy and the rules fluent and accessible. Highly recommended to watch a play through online first, then get a demo at a trade show/local store if possible. Even if you can't, if you want something meaty and intrinsically satisfying, get it. </comment>

    <comment game="Terra Mystica" game_id="120677" location="New Zealand">This could be a new favourite.  A nice mix of area control, economics, building and resource management.  Based on the box art and photos I probably would not have given it a second look, but now I love to look at the board at the end of the game.  I'm still figuring out the deepest strategies to get the absolute best out of the races.  Only downside at the moment is that it seems some races may be weaker than others, but playing with less experienced people you can just take a harder race for more of a challenge.  Love it.

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Germany">The game is fantastic - probably the best I have played so far. I had difficulties to find sleep because I was constantly thinking about the game, the moves I had made and the consequences. I've never experienced this with a game before and I'm eager to play it again.  The only (minor) critics in my eyes are the tactic cards, which slow down combat, and the playing time. You surely need to play a couple of games to finish it in under 3 or even 4 hours. But still, it's a blast and a fantastic ride! </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">Yes, it's as good as they say. Better, even!</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">This game is drenched in theme&#8212;from destroying a Death Star with a "one in a million" shot and staging daring rescues with the Millennium Falcon to inexorably subjugating the galaxy and converting Rebel heroes to the Dark Side of the Force. Other than War of the Ring, there's nothing out there that so completely immerses you in the epic feel of the source material.  The strategy feels extraordinarily deep, too. No two games are the same, because there are so many different paths to victory depending on the board state, your opponent, your leaders, where you've chosen to hide the Rebel base (or think it's hidden), etc. And despite some rumblings to the contrary, I find the combat system quite enjoyable. A fantastic game!  (area control, 3x)</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="England">Phenomenally good. FFG have refined their earlier Ameritrash triumphs to crystallise what might be the definitive long, thematic game. The probe deck mechanics and combat push this game up to a ten. The fact that an asymmetrical game can be this fun from both sides is, quite frankly, a surprise. This game is easily within reach of War of the Ring. If anything, it's actually better than that game as it doesn't feature the clunk associated with the "hunt for the ring" and other fiddly rules that are difficult to explain to newcomers. It's highly likely that I would sell members of your family to get the opportunity to play this one. Utterly brilliant.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">Deeply thematic with fairly complex but well designed rules.  Playing as the Rebels, you really do get a sense of their plight, and how hard it is to avoid detection and capture by the Imperials.  As the Imperials, you have a mighty fleet at your disposal (you start with a fully armed and operational battle station, the Death Star!), along with a fair number of systems under your control.  On some turns the Imperials will be able to produce more units than the Rebels start with!  Both factions offer an entirely asymmetrical experience, with entirely different goals.  Can the Imperials find and destroy the hidden Rebel base before the Rebels can sway the rest of the galaxy against the Imperials.  There's only one way to find out!</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="Netherlands">The one game to rule them all. With this game you go boldy where no man has gone before. A boardgame version of the old PC game Star Wars Rebellion / Supremacy. Also kind a like Star War Empire at War. Anyhow, an epic game about the Original trilogy. Strategic but with detailed characters giving the full Star Wars treatment. This is a must have! Played this a few times, it is an EPIC GAME!  Theme like War of the Ring Card driven, tension and even more a-symetric ten Twilight Struggle</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="New Zealand">There is so much going on here. The system is fantastic and plays fast. There are tons of little cinematic moments.

    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">As much as I love Imperial Assault and enjoy games like SW: TCG and the old SW minis game, there is no game that feels more like Star Wars than this one. </comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United Kingdom">The Star Wars game we all wanted. A superb realisation of Episodes 4-6 of the saga. Empire starts out a strong favourite in each game but the Rebels can win (usually on a knife's edge though). Highly immersive and the long play time quickly loses its significance as the hunt hots up. I felt a strong likeness to Fury of Dracula in the 'hide-&amp;-seek' aspect of this game which is one of my all-time favourite games and a high compliment here.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="">Rich with theme.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Note to self: old game with similar theme - Freedom in the Galaxy. Also, look at Star Wars OT Risk for homebrew variant components.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">If you are a Star Wars fan like I am and you have always wanted to play a game that just feels like quintessential Star Wars then this is the game for you!  From the moment I opened this box and saw all of the wonderfully glorious miniatures that Fantasy Flight clearly take great time to design I was hooked.  But then comes the gameplay!  Each and every move is critical to each side whether you are playing the clearly outmatched Rebellion and are trying frantically to complete objectives and hide the whereabouts of your hidden base or you are the strong and mighty Empire that are trying to span across the beautiful galaxy board to find and destroy the secret hidden rebel base.  It all just feels so...Star Wars, and I think that is the best thing this game has going for it.  I will be laying this game for years and years to come and enjoy it every time just like I did the first time I played!</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Initial Impressions: ---------------------------- Have always thought a "COIN" type game in the Star Wars universe would be really neat.  This is the first attempt at something like that, and it passes with flying colors.  The asymmetric play is intense for both sides, and the way they integrated an entire galactic battle with key leaders works so well.  Any time i have 3-4 hours free, and someone wants to play this... I am in!</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: Rebellion" game_id="187645" location="United States">Might be the best thematic experience I've had in a game that seems to have depth and strategy. Yes, I've only played it once (3 hours, 4 players), but it's beautiful in its scope and tense in its decisions. The resources are constrained enough that you always have more that you want to do and the outcomes of each decision, whether a failure or a success, is important and weighty.</comment>

Theme out the ass, every turn feeling valuable, and never a moment when anyone felt like they were potentially out of the game. Wonderful, wonderful. Lives up to all the hype and more.</comment>
    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="Malaysia">Scythe is the most anticipated game of the year 2016. Fun fact: scythe is used for both farming and war. Personally for me Scythe is an alternative to Terra Mystica, both are great games.  Mechanism and Heaviness: It's basically an action-selection game with resource management and engine building. Solid mechanic. Multiple paths to victory. Very similar to The Gallerist, each turn you choose 1 out of 4 sections with 2 actions available. You can do the top-row action, or bottom-row action, or both (top-row first), or neither. In summary: move, produce, bolster power/ popularity, build structures, deploy mechs, upgrade &amp; enlist recruits. There's no rounds or phases. It's medium heavy. It's thinky. If you like thinky Euro games like Terra Mystica, you'll like this game. Straightforward and intuitive gameplay. The depth of the game relies on the strategies players apply during the game. Almost no downtime, the turns can go very fast between players as resources are limited. Clear iconography.  Theme It's alternate-history Eastern Europa circa 1920s. Building your small empire on the map. The factions, the miniatures and encounter cards gives more thematic feeling. The encounters provide more options to get more resources, and if you spend more time to read the flavor text on the encounter cards, you get to immerse yourself into the worldbuilding, similar like Arkham Horror game. Can be retheme as Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings if you want.  Components and Setup The components are superb and top notch, so many different shapes of tokens, different types of cards, the character and mech miniatures looks great on the board! The setup feels very much like Terra Mystica with starting resources (military, combat cards, objective cards, popularity, money) and units + buildings on personal player boards. Wooden token management on the mats like in Terra Mystica and Eclipse. There are several decks like combat, encounter, objective (just need to complete one per game) and factory cards (extra action space, gained when visited The Factory for the 1st time).   Factions and Replayability Well-balanced asymmetry faction and mech abilities like in Terra Mystica. 3 out of 4 mech abilities are to improve mechs' and character's movement, while the other 1 is to improve combat. Variability created by random pairings of faction mat and player mat for each player. Terra Mystica base game has 14 different factions, with Fire and Ice expansion has another 6 factions (10 different coloured boards), Scythe base game has 5 faction boards and 5 player boards, with 25 different combinations. With the Invaders from Afar expansion, there's gonna be 49 combinations! The replayability is high. Different faction, different starting available terrains, different strategies. You've got to adapt to your surrounding.  Actions TOP: move/ gain money (by moving, there can be combat/ encounter/ factory), bolster military power/ gain combat cards, trade resources/ gain popularity or produce on tiles (different tile different resource, resources stay on board with worker: wood, oil, metal, food or worker); BOTTOM (pay with resources): upgrade (move cube from top row to bottom row for discount), deploy mechs (special faction abilities), build structures (mine/ monument/ armory/ mill) or enlist recruits (1-time bonus and unlock action-reaction). Dual benefits of the upgrade system - increase top-row action benefit and decrease bottom-row action cost. Some small reminders: mechs share abilities with character, not workers, which include riverwalk; mech and workers can transport resources; mill is an extra territory for production; enlist ongoing bonus include activation from active player and immediate neighbours.  Combat Threat of combat is constant, but not mandatory. Deterministic combat systemu sing power dial and combat cards like in Dune/ Rex (also Game of Thrones, Forbidden Stars, Cosmic Encounters). Add numbers on power dial (up to military power to spend) and numbers on combat cards (2 - 5, depend on number of units on tile except worker). The combat resolved fast, unlike those other games. Sometimes a game can be without combat. Each faction need only to win 2 combats to put 2 achievement stars on triumph track except the Saxony. Combat will lower attacker's popularity if there is any retreating workers from the opposition faction. There are no units/ structures destroyed, only retreating to home base.  Endgame Endgame condition triggers when 1 player put 6 stars on the triumph track after fulfilling various requirements. The stars will come out very fast towards the end of the game. Unique endgame condition, very similar to console gaming with the achievement stars on triumph track. Most money win - popularity (love) reminiscent to Euphoria's morale track affect how much money collected for each stars, territories controlled (The Factory counts as 3 territories) and resources controlled. Plus random structure bonus scoring tile.     Solo Variant - Automa There are 4 levels of difficulty, Autometta for easy, Automa for normal, Automaszyna for hard and Ultimaszyna for hardcore. The Automa cards make the solo variant plays very smoothly. Mostly the Automa units would aim to reach The Factory. The solo variant is as good as The Gallerist's.   Final Thoughts Scythe is a keeper. Fans of Terra Mystica, The Gallerist, Eclipse and Game of Thrones will be at home with this game, with extra ability to play solo. Reputable designer of Viticulture and Euphoria fame. Watch Rodney's Watch It Played video before playing the game really helps you understand how the game flows.   Expansion The expansion with extra 2 factions is a must, the board just scream for epic 7-players game! With the base game, it's War of the Five Kings, with the expansion, it's gonna be Battle of the Seven Kingdoms! </comment>

    <comment game="Scythe" game_id="169786" location="United States">I absolutely love this game!  It strikes an excellent balance between planning (strategy) and response (tactics).  I like how the combat/pvp nature of the game is well balanced - there is such a dual-edged nature to combat that players think long and hard before committing to them and it can be strategically advantageous to eat a loss rather than over commit and obtain a victory.  In addition (and this is for games of 3+ players), you have to consider how winning 1 combat weakens your overall ability to defend yourself and opens you up to combat from other players.  It really is well done.  I also like the engine building.  It's not a complicated engine, but the operations required to establish the engine and utilize it are varied enough that players have many choices to make.  In addition, those choices tend to be very deep - they are the tip of the iceberg, a snowball that may or may not lead to the ultimate goal (global world domination or something like that).  It's the depth of gameplay that keeps me coming back.  I like the dual nature of upgrades.  You uncover a benefit and cover a cost.  It's such a nice way of offering compelling, meaningful choices with real consequences.  The variance in starting position/mats is fantastic!  The combination of faction + player mat makes for some real differences in terms of the best strategy to utilize.  And then you have to consider the goals, which may or may not be worth pursuing.  Plenty of choices!  I love the art in this game.  Pastoral and very thematic.  The illustrations help frame the game in a larger context.  It wasn't strictly necessary, and not everyone likes or enjoys it, but I think it adds character to the bigger package and presentation.  Production value is excellent!  Even the base game is high quality.  The additional pieces (metal coins, board extension, realistic resource tokens) are much appreciated!  I strongly recommend using glass markers/beads in place of the cardboard exploration tokens.  The cardboard tokens get lost among the board's colorful artwork.  3d beads are *MUCH* easier to see and improve gameplay.  My primary criticism is that games will often end with an unequal number of turns.  This is something that [u][url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/23299059#23299059]I discussed in the forums[/url][/u].  I have two "answers" for this point.  My first inclination, as suggested by sethvanorden in that thread, is to use turn order as a handy cap modifier.  Very easy and very understandable.  My second thought is to give a small compensation to those players who received one less turn - an award on the order of 5 coins or so.  Small, insufficient, but enough to reduce the sting and say "I feel your pain but I'm not giving you 100% insurance coverage."  I think either or both of those will help.  Overall, this is just a fantastic game.  I think there's enough depth to keep me interested for a long time without overwhelming players.  Also, the play time hits a sweet, [i]sweet[/i] spot - 2 hours once people are familiar.  There are potential swings and not everything is 100% balanced, but it shouldn't be.  This is not a pure abstract - it's a thematic euro.  You want it unbalanced enough to provide options, but not so off-kilter that the whole system wobbles out of control.  And it hits that spot beautifully.  Try it.  [gameid=169786] may or may not be your cup o' tea, but I'd give it better than even odds that you see and appreciate at least some of its carefully crafted beauty.</comment>

Incredibly great game-play. Personally love that one person cannot dominate by destroying others in combat without damaging themselves. It seems well balanced and intuitive.

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Canada">An Agricola variant, which means a high strategy, option-filled, "thematic", feeding-tension, worker placement game with great components and great scalability.  If you know Agricola you practically know how to play this game.  There are 12 instead of 14 rounds and each round you select an action (once chosen no one else can choose it), and periodically (with increasing frequency) you have a harvest where you get crop yields, feed your people and have animal husbandry.  This time you're a family of dwarves (odd yes) carving out a home in the mountains and growing a farm outside.   There are a set number of actions to choose from that differ based on the number of players and a fixed set of actions that come into play each round like in Agricola.   The main differences from Agricola are: 1) there are no cards. Instead the variability/special abilities/special point generators are in the form of rooms that can be built and these are ALL in play and OPEN to all players from the beginning similar to Agricola: all creatures big and small 2) there are now quests. Quests involve forging weapons using a new resource, ore, and selecting action spaces that allow you to choose free goods from a menu of items. The better your weapon the better the choices and the more you use your weapon the better it gets.  3) scoring is more open. There are no minimums or maximums for scoring for example 20 vegetables is worth 20 points instead of being capped at 4 points and you don't get minus 1 point for not having any (caveat: you still lose points for having empty spaces on your board and for missing animal types) 4) there is another new resource, rubies, which are like a wild card. All rubies are worth 1 point each, but they can also be used to purchase almost anything at any time 5) family growth is not essential. You can go for growth but since family members are only worth 1 point instead of 3 points but still cost the same amount of food and there are more opportunities to grow and the game rounds are less, yes you can certainly win with only 2 players (after over 250 face to face games of Agricola I don't believe that is true for that game) 6) feeding is more flexible. Notice I said more flexible but contrary to what some people are saying it is NOT easy it is still a grind mainly because harvests occur nearly every round! 7) the game is 2 rounds shorter and scales from 1-7(!) players  I love Agricola it's my favourite game so naturally I really enjoy Caverna it gives me the same/similar flavour and feel but it's different enough that it feels fresh. If you enjoy one you will enjoy the other and most likely vice versa. Is it worth owning both?  Absolutely. I imagine that eventually there will be building expansions similar to how there are the card expansions for Agricola.   Own the [boardgame=166187]mini-expansion[/boardgame], the [boardgame=183531]Water Features[/boardgame], as well as homemade [boardgame=154204]Christmas Chamber[/boardgame] and [boardgame=160803]LARP and Cosplay[/boardgame] promo tiles.</comment>

    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="United States">1-6(4)  Okay, so this game is gigantic, and has all sorts of crazy components.  It is very much a challenge to know if I prefer this to Agricola. I think they both do have a place.  Maybe I'm just too seasoned an Agricola player, but Caverna does feel quite a bit less tense than Agricola with the feeding and the need to grow your family, among other things.  And so, by its very nature, I guess Uwe had to compress many of the Agricola actions (getting fields and pastures going is easier, as is expanding your cave, and etc.) so that he could add something new and different (the adventuring). The game is fluid and takes out a bit of the mess of Agricola and it's nice that players can transition between the different tracks (adventuring and farming), but it doesn't feel much *more* than Agricola, just different. Enjoyable, though.  The big thing, of course, is the overload in getting the hundred community improvements upfront versus the cards. I understand Uwe's gradual move toward no luck, static setup games, but there is indeed something fun in looking at your initial hand of cards trying to suss out the synergies and the interactions and trying to build a game plan. That part of Agricola DID add a lot of interesting direction to any particular game session.</comment>
    <comment game="Caverna: The Cave Farmers" game_id="102794" location="Spain">Este es el juego que me hubiera gustado que fuera Agricola.  Mas opciones que en &#233;ste &#250;ltimo. Menos sufrimiento en las partidas, cosa que personalmente agradezco limitando las penalizaciones.  Me parece un acierto eliminar los oficios/adquisiones,etc y que ahora esten disponibles los edificios para todos. (no tardaran demasiado en sacar mas edificios y/o alguna nueva ampliaci&#243;n).  Pese a tener mucho carton lo veo un poco caro (materiales para 7 personas, no veo como organizar una partida a tanta gente)  Por mucho que la gente diga, si se tiene ya el Agricola adquirir un caverna o viceversa es totalmente innecesario; demasiado similares.</comment>

One of the most popular games in my group, and probably still the best game I've ever played.

    <comment game="The Castles of Burgundy" game_id="84876" location="United Kingdom">Stefan Feld's best game to date. The supreme euro gaming experience without the overt heaviness of games like Agricola and Caverna. A sublime two player experience that doesn't compromise at three or four. If you have a spare &#163;30 or equivalent for this hobby and you don't own this, buy it, and you can still find it cheaper than that RRP. </comment>

I know that I should be sparing with "10s" but everything about this game does it for me.  I like the tile mechanics and the small combos you can make.  I like the multiple scoring options.

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Spain">I've been holding out for a year and a half before allowing anything to be as good as chess despite playing excellent game after excellent game thanks to recommendations on the geek but Agricola has cracked my resolve. Simply superb. Fast but filled with tough decisions. Only played with two and it has a perfect level of player interaction. No two games are the same. Complex where it needs to be and simple where it needs to be. It may take a while but it is destined to be number one. Congratulations to all concerned. It's a masterpiece. </comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Canada">Very thematic worker placement game, with excellent scalability and good variability, about building the best farm.  It's hard to believe that such a strategic "gamer's game" could be so accessible to the average non-gamer, and that it's designed by Uwe Rosenberg of all people (of Bohnanza fame).  This is a game that once played, people want to immediately play it again.  Despite the fact that the main mechanism is worker placement, which is getting overly tired these days, the game still feels fresh, as it has a very unique and strong theme.  Plus the huge amount of cards (occupation, which add special abilities/skills, and minor improvements, which again add special abilities) adds variability.  It should be noted that the cards are not nearly as crucial to gameplay as one would think.  I have bitched and moaned practically every game I've played about my terrible starting hand, and won most of those games without the need to play hardly any cards (although I would hope that having and playing a lot of strong cards is a viable strategy- edit: it is, as I've even won by playing a lot of crap cards).  The components are very good (particularly if you have the animeeples, which I do), the scalability is excellent, and the game, while lasting 14 rounds, goes by very quickly and gives you a lot to think about during and after the completion of the game.  It's all about balance, balance, balance, as points are awarded (or deducted) for essentially every possible category in the game (3 different animal types, vegetables, grain, pastures, fields, stables, family members, filled/empty spaces, buildings, cards, etc.).  If ever a "gamer's game" is to become mainstream, and break through to the masses, this is that game.  I've recently noticed this for sale at Indigo/Chapters, which is a real positive sign (they've expanded their zone beyond Settlers and Carcassonne).  Edit: Agricola is long gone from those shelves, looks like the herd weren't up to the challenge after all, too bad.  Anyways, this game is definitely deserving of it's overall #1 ranking here on BGG!

    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Malaysia">ON: acqsn Sep 08. Pre-order set with animeeples &amp; Z-deck. Can't seem to get enough plays of this! Who can resist the animeeples?</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">A late November tradition for the entire family! Update: 6/10 - Wow, I don't want to lower it's rating. I'm even tempted to nudge it up from 9.5. Must be my sparing and intermittent plays.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United Kingdom">A water tight game. Just genius. The huge number of cards that come with the game give it near endless re-playability (not to mention the countless other cards available). After playing this, I realised how far board games have evolved since my childhood days playing Talisman! </comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="United States">After a few plays at BGG.con '07 I can safely say that the hype is totally justified! I haven't felt this way about a game since I discovered Settlers oh so long ago... my German copy is on it's way, and the Z-Man edition has been pre-ordered. I am officially obsessed!The game itself is wonderful... so many paths emerge from the card variance and the actions picked that it would be hard to see two games go the same way. I can't wait to immerse myself in this one! UPDATE: I have played solo, two-player, three-player, four-player and five-player. I have loved it all! Each iteration is a little different, which adds yet another great level to the game (resource availability, timing issues, etc). This game will end up being a 10 for me, I am sure. UPDATE: After 25 plays and still wanting to only play this game above all others, I am going to upgrade to a 10. This game is not perfect, but for me, it doesn't get much better.</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Canada">Learning:medium Teaching:medium Comment: Agricola is a excellent strategie game. </comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="Brazil">Best game ever, my group always wanna play this one. Once everyone is at a good level on this, it just gets pretty tight to win!</comment>
    <comment game="Agricola" game_id="31260" location="England">Given my job as a property fund manager whose portfolio includes English farms this was always going to appeal. Well over 20 games played now and one of the most popular for our group in 2008. Brilliant game with tremendous theme. Very well balanced so that each of the main paths to victory has its own opportunity costs The only version I find slightly odd is the solo game, which is more of an efficency puzzle.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Germany">Rating after only three plays (one beginner level, two intermediate). This was so worth the wait...and the money! I want to play it all the time and can't wait to try the full game because it always seems too short. Definitely my hot game of the moment.  Update: After 5 plays upgraded to a 10. It's frustrating and awesome and may just be my favourite game ever.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Canada">Civilization in a box. It doesn't have a map, but it has everything else. I really feel like I'm running a nation and advancing eras. Every time you pay you get different choices that steer your game in different directions. This is tied for my favorite game of all time, but that could change after I play the new one. :)</comment>

My current note is 7.5, but I see the potential for more. 3 plays, one full, great game, I want to plat more and gain more experience</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Brazil">My favorite 2 player game. For my geek happyness, my girlfriend just loves it :)</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Canada">The only game I rated without playing because just reading the rules I was massively impressed!  This is going to be fun!  Update: The game did NOT disappoint! </comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="United Kingdom">Currently my favourite game of all, this has stood up to many repeated plays and I still haven't got my head around ideal play in different situations; the theme is perfect for me, streamlined civilization building without all the assymettry of a map that tends to create unbalanced games. the cards feel perfectly balanced, highlighted by different groups thinking different cards are broken, they rarely are they are just all situational.  Played with a fast group of two to three players this is a perfect game, I don't particularly like 4 player games as they seem to drag a bit too much.

    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="Finland">TtA is a real gem, also as a two-player game.</comment>
    <comment game="Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization" game_id="25613" location="">We played a couple of turns of the simple game.  I think the rules are somewhat elegant and clever, love the idea of building a civilization, and like that it is a card game.  "Seeding" events seems fun, and rumor has it the 2-player advanced game can be done in under two hours once you know what you're doing.  UPDATE:  After one advanced game, I'm calling this a seriously good game.  It's long, but I don't know how that can be avoided.  The mechanics work, it's not too annoying to keep track of things, and it moves along.  Yes, you can take a break during your opponent's turn.  It's good enough to make me want a full game next time (Mrs. alexd trounced me by clever military among other things).  Ok, the full game is even better, though it pretty much adds an hour and a half, at least at first.  Seems like playing an age an evening for a few days might be the way to go -- take a break, ponder your progress, mull over the layout over breakfast...  Ok, the full game is fantastic, AFTER Age I.   Playing less than the full game seems like a foolish waste of time -- the overhead for the good part is too high.  UPDATE:  Ok, so.  In theory there's a lot to like here.  In practice, 2p, between making mistakes in resource management/cardplay if you're trying to play at a reasonable pace but make time for thinking, the game ends up taking FOREVER and having a disturbing "some mistake was made" feeling that isn't there in most things I like.  I love the idea here, in some ways, but the actual game isn't as great, after more plays, as I thought.  Perhaps... if the leaders were more balanced?  If there were more interesting eventful turns rather than slow runups to the occasional war?  It's not REALLY a 10, in some ways (well it may be when it's firing on all cylinders, but that often fails to happen, and it sure takes a long time for it), but... eh, at its best its great.  Just a warning -- it's not perfect.  Is it infinitely more fun and cooler than Agricola?  OH YEAH</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">There are few games that I think about during the day and truly feel excited to play when I get home. This is one of those games! Yes, it is rules heavy. But my 14 year old and I really had no trouble figuring out how to play. Yes, it is long. But the more you play, the faster the games go. I highly recommend this game if you have learned other complex games like Twilight Imperium or Sid Meir's Civilization. If you can handle those games then you can handle this one.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United Kingdom">Not quite my favourite game, but if I could only have 1 game  for the rest of my life, it would probably be this.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="Sweden">This game might look ugly (at least part of it), but it's wonderfully deep and engaging. Definitely in my top five. The epic scale, strategic planning aspect and balanced character development keeps it engaging through six-hour sessions. Highly recommended to any hardcore gamer.  The rulebook and intro scenario book are great, in my opinion, and I have found that I actually have to consult BBG less than with many other games. On the whole the game is a tight, complex challange where you have to always keep your eyes on your goal to get there in the end.  Rating is based on few plays and might change.  EDIT: Have now played it a couple more times since giving the game a 10, and I'm NOT changing the rating. What a game!</comment>

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United Kingdom">Amazing game! A must have for me. Only played solo and 2 players and it's my all time favourite.

    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">This game makes a great first impression.  I've played four times (oddly enough once each with 1, 2, 3, and 4 players).  Definitely a solid 8, I just think a game should be played more before rating it any higher.  Edit: After a year and with the addition of the Lost Legion expansion, I have to raise the rating to a 10.  This game has wonderful solo play and I will always play whenever someone suggests it.</comment>
    <comment game="Mage Knight Board Game" game_id="96848" location="United States">One giant puzzle with huge replayabilty.  Great theme.  Lots of thought required.  Overall a really immersive game that keeps you coming back.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Canada">[2012-01-21]  Okay, opened it last night, inventoried everything, set up the board just to get a feel of everything, and I'm maybe 3/4 through the rule book, and things are starting to click in.  But then it was almost midnight, and my brain just couldn't absorb anything anymore, so I went to the other room, and played "Wrath of Ashardalon" for maybe half an hour before going to bed.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">A very tight design! The designer captures both the Fellowship of the Ring story involving taking the ring to volcano to destroy as well as the battle for Middle Earth and the return of the King and the ascension of Gandalf.  Much of the story (at least as much as I know it) is contained in the game while and you are playing a great game of resource, dice, and card management.  It's a bit long, but so were the books and so were the movies: you simply cannot tell this epic tale in a short setting.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Brazil">Para mim este &#233; o melhor jogo j&#225; publicado em termos de adapta&#231;&#227;o, ambienta&#231;&#227;o e imers&#227;o. A parida &#233; uma verdadeira imers&#227;o no universo dos livros e sonho com o dia em que eles lancem algo para o Silmarillion (assim como fizeram com o Hobitt - Batalha dos 5 Ex&#233;rcitos).  O jogo tem mec&#226;nicas at&#233; simples, por&#233;m s&#227;o dezenas de detalhes, fases e para quem nunca jogou, recomendo fortemente a leitura do manual duas vezes, assistir reviews, gameplays e explica&#231;&#227;o de regras, al&#233;m de ter ajuda aos jogadores a m&#227;o o tempo todo.  Um jogo que todo f&#227; de Senhor dos An&#233;is merece e precisa ter na cole&#231;&#227;o. Se n&#227;o tiver, merece pelo menos passar pela experi&#234;ncia de jogar ele.

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="Poland">Rated after four plays.  The game is absolutely great, both as game play and the quality of components. The miniatures are fantastic, the only thing to complain about is the design of the map.  EDIT: My rating changed from 9.25 to 9.75. After several plays we still got a few rules wrong but not enough to change the outcome of the game. I find War of the Ring to be the third best game I played lately and I will play it again many time. The strategy is different from game to game, the balancing in amazing and there's a thrill from beginning to the end.  EDIT: The game feels amazing after several plays and it's should be a straight 10 if not for the poor map graphics. We're thinking to modify and print our own map to make the gaming experience truly exceptional. There's tension in every game and it's always on the edge, with the "if I only rolled a 6..." being the last phrase. My best game of 2013 without doubt.  EDIT: after one more play I am changing the rating to a clean 10. The balance, the diversity of choices and the perfect mix of theme and game play makes War of the Ring one of the best games I ever played </comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="England">A masterpiece. It's hard to learn, difficult to teach and you better have plenty of time to hash it out - but none of that matters. The moment it goes back in the box I want it on the table again. Mechanically, it's superb; thematically, it's perfect.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">Probably the most 'epic' feeling game in my collection. You set this up and look at the table and you know you're about to start something amazing.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="South Africa">Best game I've ever played.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">One of my favorite games and maybe the best heavy two player war game available.  The theme will be very appealing to most and it is well expressed through every aspect of the game.  If you know the books then it's a lot of fun to see the story unfold with slight variations.  All the characters and armies are there and they work just like they should.  It also works well for me because I don't feel like it's as ultra-complex as lots of the other two player war games I've tried.  Just it's still complex, but it's also streamlined.  The best idea that this game captures from the book is that the war is fought on two fronts.  You have the armies clashing trying to take control of important cities, but you also have ring mission trying to sneak in and win the game.    The game requires you to pay attention to both fronts and figure out how to divide up your resources because neglecting either one will give your opponent the win.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">Epic LOTR war game. Win with military victories or by destroying/finding the ring. Lots of strategy, lots of choices, long gameplay, excellent atmosphere.</comment>
    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">Rating based on WOW factor. This game is deep and somewhat complicated. The anxiety of watching the fellowship dwindle as they advance is fantastic. Best lord of the Rings grand scale war-game ever made to date. Better than 1st edition from FFG.</comment>

    <comment game="War of the Ring (second edition)" game_id="115746" location="United States">There are a great many Lord of the Rings themed games on the market right now and I think it is safe to say that this is easily one of the best out there.  The theme of the game is incredible and when I explain this to people, I often call it "Lord of the Rings" in a box.  When first looking at this game, there are a few things which stand out to people and the first and foremost is "look!  It's Lord of the Rings Risk!"  That can not be farther from the truth.  While the initial reaction may be that statement, you soon realize with all of the decisions that it is far from just Lord of the Rings Risk.    Whether it comes from the decisions of the Fellowship of the Ring, or from a military victory, the free peoples can end this game fairly quickly if they play their cards right.  But the overwhelming decisions of what to do first can make it quite difficult for the free peoples to win the game.  The easiest way for the shadow to win the game is through a military victory, though it is quite lengthy.  The reason I say this is the easiest way is due to the decisions made by the free peoples.  If you go into the game looking to corrupt the ring bearer, the entire game is based on waiting for the Free peoples to move the Fellowship.  It seems as though they can control the timing of the game, which is one of the genius mechanics of the game.  The shadow has the obvious advantage in the military victory, but the Free peoples can control the length of the game.  All in all, this game is one of the best I have played in my collection.  Every time it comes out on the table, there is a different game which is being played.  While I have not yet played with the expansion, I am looking forward to it in our following plays.    If you are looking for the perfect Lord of the Rings game, look not further.</comment>

It is the best game in my collection. It has been a hit for my wife, my gaming buddies went crazy for it, and I find that I can't get it to the table often enough to make me happy.

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">First play:1\23\16 2 and a half hours (3 people did research on the game, 4th was in for a game at the last minute, all had not played before.)  I rated it a 10 in December 2015, (after watching videos, I was psyched!) so I rated it a 10 before playing, Was I hasty?   NO! It was that good!, Will I buy it? (low income, $80, Long,) maybe, only time will tell. (one more play probably.)  Oh yeah, I forgot to say I WON AT 125 points! (every one else gave me loki cards in the draft.)   I got 4 figures destroyed in Ragnorok (16) times 2 for double all glory in by dying in Ragnorok. then I had 3 glory each person released from Valhala (2 cards) 8 people released (24) those two things were almost half my victory!   phenomenal combos, leading into an awesome game! </comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="United States">Wow, not over-hyped at all. Simply fantastic.</comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="Malaysia">Blood Rage is one of the few area control with action points allowance system &amp; card drafting that I like, because even in death I can still gain glory! It doesn't take long time to finish, the rules are streamlined &amp; easy to understand though there are few cards that's a bit confusing, plus the minis are super awesome! The clans are all cosmetic only with no variable clan power but I still wish for the Ram clan hahaha! The game reminds me of Cosmic Encounter, Game of Thrones, Smallworld &amp; King of Tokyo. </comment>
    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="Canada">Currently my favorite game. It really does put a smile on my face. Win or Lose! :-D  It offers most things on my checklist: Vikings Card Drafting Area Control  It does so much more but my one complain is new players are at a huge disadvantage to experienced players as this games bread and butter is synergy of cards.  That can be said for most games though so its a minor complaint. I never turn down a chance to bring this one out!</comment>

    <comment game="Blood Rage" game_id="170216" location="Germany">In my view, (one of) the game(s) of the decade. As I said to Eric Lang (who I had the great honour to talk to at the Spiel 2015): In my eyes already a classic. Different, fresh, exciting, tricky, smooth, full of flavour... I could go on forever. If there was an 11 to give, I'd rate it 11 and then some. Buy! Play! Enjoy!</comment>
    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Germany">Beautiful mechanics. I actually enjoy the calculation part which seems to turn some people off. The theme is very refreshing after lots of "let's build random stuff set in a nondescript medieval period" games (don't get me wrong - I love those!), and way more exciting than it might sound. It's also quite easy to understand, rule-wise, so the basic principles can be explained to others in no time at all. This game just *works* for me.</comment>

    <comment game="Power Grid" game_id="2651" location="Australia">The godfather of the economic simulation, Power Grid is an excellent medium weight, mathy game that can lead to very intense scenarios, particularly at the bidding table.

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="">Awesome!  Every game is like a scifi novel!</comment>
    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Finland">I've had the privilege and pleasure of being involved in the playtesting of the prototype since May 2010 and saw it evolve. The game I played back then was great.. the finished game is phenomenal!   The game is truly an epic 4X civilization-building game, but it doesn't take all day to play. It is built upon very intuitive mechanics that allow you to play the [i]game[/i], not the system. It is in essence very much a eurogame with loads and loads of highly immersive theme seamlessly integrated into the package.   The gameplay is so exciting it keeps you at the edge of your seat, but the balance between strategy and luck feels good (by playing smart, luck is [i]very[/i] manageable).   First rating after first (early prototype) playtest games: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#66FF99][COLOR=#66FF99]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]8.5[/b][/size][COLOR=#66FF99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - May 2010  Improved rating after several (developed prototype) playtest games: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC99][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=6][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]9[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - November 2010  Improved rating after more (late prototype) playtest games: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC99][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]9.5[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - March 2011  May 2011 Update: The finished game and components design is simply exceptional. If the production value is right, I fully expect to give this game full marks.  Rating after playing the the final (pre)production copy: [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC00][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=2][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]10[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size] - The quality of game components is as high as the ambitious design deserves. The game looks gorgeous and plays like a dream. I'm pretty sure this will become my favourite board game of all time.  UPDATE: I'm finding some people's complaints about "luck" more and more ridiculous. They're only indicative of their own inexperience and inability to play the game well. The rules are deceptively easy to grasp but true understanding of different strategies and how to play the game competitively might take a lot more effort. Apparently some people never get it.   I just played a game (including the expansion in playtesting) where 6 out of my 7 explores where ancients, including my first four hex pulls and I was sitting next to Draco. I ended up discarding two hexes over the course of the game and even the only one without an ancient had a Warp gate. Sounds bad? I was "screwed by luck"? You know what happened? I won by a landslide, because I adapted to the situation and chose my strategy accordingly.   The game has several random elements to ensure replayability and excitement, but calling it "luck-based" is a load of bull****. </comment>

    <comment game="Eclipse" game_id="72125" location="Finland">2012-02-06 After numerous plays of the final product: Excellent production value + A game that keeps you in its grip still after several plays = A TEN  2016-10-12 Eclipse satisfies the need for a civilization game in almost every possible way. It is epic enough without suffering from being too long or being guilty of too much micromanaging that ultimately has no or very little impact on the outcome of the game. Every action you take feels significant and almost always you are one or two actions short of accomplishing everything you want which creates interesting trade-offs to ponder. Eclipse also manages to overcome the hurdle of book-keeping with your ever growing empire. All information is easy to read and very little time is spent on calculating things allowing you to concentrate solely on playing. And perhaps the coolest thing about the whole game is that you get to create your own ship blueprints!!!  There are a few minor things that might start to annoy you after a while though. First off, the non-player enemies (Ancients) are all the same. On the couple of first plays this won't bother you but personally I would have liked some variety to them. Now you have a bunch of standard ship blueprints you use to defeat the Ancients thus making this part of the game a bit scripted. However, the number and the timing of Ancients you encounter varies from game to game and hence this does not script the whole experience.  Another thing about the Ancients is that especially for new players they may seem invincible. Many have been ready to throw the game after "bad luck" with exploring when they have found their homeworld being surrounded by Ancients. I must say that the situation may seem dire but you can usually make a comeback and fight for the win. However, facing this kind of a situation on your first play can be truly devastating for the experience causing these players never to look back once they leave the table.  Third thing is that after a few rounds there is very little incentive to add a odd number of hull to your ship blueprints. All more powerful weapons deal an even number of damage thus making odd hull useless. Hence there are times when the Improved Hull technology feels a bit over powered to me. This feeling is further magnified by the Plasma Missile technology.  Fourth and perhaps my biggest complaint is about the art. I really like the subtle and extremely functional graphic design which helps to create a right kind of atmosphere. But oh man, the generic art on the faction sheets and the box really is not to my taste. Almost all alien races are of humanoid type thus showing very little imagination. It almost feels like watching Star Trek. Moreover, all races are portrayed from the front with their torso and face visible. It makes me feel like I am at a gallery of mugshots.  Nevertheless, despite its minor shortcomings Eclipse is truly a great game that delivers you bags of fun. You are operating on both, the short term tactical level and on the longer term strategic level. You also get the satisfaction of actually accomplishing something when you watch your empire grow. Personally I also love the sci-fi setting.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="Canada">This is probably the most thematic game I own. It so perfectly captures being stranded on a desert island, the thrill of discovering something that'll save you, the crushing dread of a giant wild animal attacking you and then the deflation of defeat when he comes back several turns later to eat your food too. The rules are written terribly but I ignore this so readily because the different parts work together so well and we just get lost in the theme.</comment>

    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="">amazing game with endless replayability!!!!</comment>
    <comment game="Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island" game_id="121921" location="United States">Pros:  Great theme, very challenging, adjustable difficulty.  Expandability.  Replayability.  This game beats Arkham Horror for me in the coop category for several reasons.  1.) less fiddliness.  2.) more randomish surprise elements...leading to more varied play experiences.  3.) the fight to survive feels more real, and the desire to play again to do better is there.  Cons:  Can be difficult to adjust the difficulty to where it is a challenge without being an impossibility.  Rules book is bad.  Do yourself a favor and download the many helpful pdfs on the geek that people have posted, this saves much time and aggravation.  All or nearly all of the rules information *is* in the book, but its not laid out logically leading to frustration.    I have played this so far solo, and solo as 4 chars.  I find solo to be very hard, also I found solo as 4 chars very hard.  However, Solo as 4 chars + Friday &amp; dog made the game challenging without the sense of impossibility.  I like this aspect.  I will be playing this with my nieces soon, and it will be good to keep Friday and the dog for that playthrough due to them (the girls) making sub-optimal choices due to lack of experience, and so I won't feel like I will have to alpha-game it just to survive.  This is a big point.  The alpha-gamer trait will rise in the alpha-gamer if he/she feels that they will lose without optimal choices.  If, however, there is a sufficient buffer of sub-optimal play choices, the alpha gamer trait will be rendered tolerable (this is my theory).  </comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Canada">Amazing game.  The rules are positively Byzantine but getting over that, it really is a fantastic game.  Truly well-balanced in that multiple strategies will lead to victory, and the optimal strategy depends not only on your card draw, but also your opponent's actions.  Somebody said in a review that Brass is a game where you develop a number of parasitic relationships with your opponents.  I think that's right on the money and what I like so much about the game.</comment>

Imagining myself playing this with 3 other dedicated people makes me have goose-pimples, as it were. It's the system... I just don't notice time when I play this game; it's the system... it has limitless possibilities for future games. The cards provide the replayability (helped along by the Distant Market tiles). They give a surprising amount of flexibility without determining your play (opposite in Race for the Galaxy). The demand and space of the board changes with each game according to what, in what proportion, and when industry tiles are being played; every game has a different narrative. And the "coopitition" is amazing! Brass provides all of this and more with so few components. [b]Brilliant game!!![/b]</comment>
    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="Greece">Martin Wallace's masterpiece! What a great economic game! Lot's of hard decisions and a very nice mechanic using your cards in your hand as a means to play and to trigger the end of the canal age and the end of game. The board is simple but that makes it easier to see things and more functional that way.</comment>

    <comment game="Brass" game_id="28720" location="">Fantastic game! Martin Wallace's best by far. I don't usually like games that rely on cards but there is plenty of flexibility in this game so there is minimal luck factor with the cards. My only minor complaints are that it has a few weird quirks and the quality of the money is not good. It's not designed for 2 players but there is a good variant on BGG that works well. boardgamegeek.com/filepage/30555/variant-rules-2-player-game</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="">Awesomeness in a box.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Canada">Worker placement game (yet again!), where you want to grab resources, and convert these resources into points (buildings + ships).  This game definitely shows signs of its predecessors (Agricola, Caylus, etc), but despite not being terribly original, and being overly long, it has something about it that gets it to the table regularly (it definitely helps that my wife really likes it).  Essentially, it's a 1-5 player game, where depending on the number of players, there is a set number of rounds (I usually play 3-players, and I think that's 18 rounds), during which time, you "fill the board" with varying resources, then choose to: 1)grab a resource pile, OR 2)build a building or ship.  Also at any time, you can buy and/or sell buildings.  The goal is to get the most points, and money also equals points.  At the end of each round, you have to pay food, similar to Agricola, and if you can't meet the food requirements (which can also be paid with money), you get loan(s), similar to beggar cards.  The main difference here is that it's not a big deal to get loans and paying off your food isn't as draining as it is in Agricola (not that it's easy).  You only get 1 worker to place, so you always want to do more than you can do on a given turn, and you are often torn between grabbing that huge pile of wood/clay/money etc. or building that valuable building.  Also, similar to Caylus, you use your own buildings for free, but have to pay (food and/or money) when you use other players or the towns buildings (usually).  All in all, not as good as Agricola, but still very solid- oddly enough a couple of friends like this better than Agricola, and my wife seems to want to play this as much as Agricola right now.  Seems like it scales well, BUT it's definitely a long game, which might make it prohibitive to play 5 player games (have only played 2-4 players so far).  Thanks again for making another solid gamer's game Uwe, looking forward to your next game(s)!.

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United States">This is a newcomer, having only hit the tables a few times. Too deep for the kids -- INITIALLY. This will change, as they are asking a million questions. They certainly pick things up fast. It's possible this will rate higher, but for now it's an 8... and solidly there. Nice game, if a little on the long side.  UPDATE: The nine year-old played through about half of the two player game (not the short version). He loved it. This will see table-time again.  UPDATE 2: Le Havre and Agricola are two of our family's favorite games.  UPDATE 3: My only gripe with Le Havre is that it's LONG with more than... one. Still, a wonderful game.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United Kingdom">Incredible euro game about goods conversion. So many viable strategies, fair and balanced. The games is also quite different for 2-5 players due to the different buildings used so very large replayability factor. Cool artwork, I cannot see myself tiring of this game. Genius.</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Canada">Great game!  I'm looking forward to going through all the nooks and crannies of this game, however long that might take.  I can't wait for this to hit the table!</comment>
    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="Finland">A hard game that gets even tougher with increasing player numbers. Better than Agricola, because in this game, you feel like you have a lot of great choices whereas in Agricola you try to figure out which choice is the least bad. However still not worth a 10... maybe lacks some theme and immersion.  Update October/2010: 9 -&gt; 10 Le Havre is simply the best resource management game out there. Valid strategies a numerous and the game always takes a new course.    2015-11-04 To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. It seems that nowadays the games hitting the table are action packed sub 90 minute games instead of longer ones. This is especially true for Le Havre, which I basically recommend only for max 3 players, and still you should play the shortened version unless every one was familiar with the game. If I only had more space to store my games...   2016-10-26 The absolutely best thing about Le Havre is the positive atmosphere around the game. You seem to have an endless number of good alternatives to choose from. But this does not mean that your choices are insignificant or anything. Actually they are far from it. Everything requires careful planning still. You are usually better off if you are following a longer term plan in your game. However, sometimes it is just too tempting to deviate from the path you have planned to take. Thus you are facing many interesting decisions throughout the game.  If there is something to criticise about Le Havre, it would come down to two things. First one is the length. I basically recommend the game for 2-3 players only and still you should consider playing the shortened version. Thankfully the short game delivers almost the same experience as the full game. The second negative that the special buildings in the full game do not seem to have big enough of an impact to justify doubled play time over the shortened game. The special buildings are just too situational often requiring a certain resource generation infrastructure to be up and running before you can benefit from the them. And preparing the infra may be difficult because you do not know which buildings will be available. Thus in most games you just ignore them all together.  So, a full game of Le Havre is a bit long but the shortened game is golden.

    <comment game="Le Havre" game_id="35677" location="United Kingdom">A game that sucks you in. Sometimes you see your game engine develop and then you expand too quickly and you slow down. The range of options is stunning and this becomes boggling to see the woood from the trees. Brilliant brilliant game.  Updated from a 9 in August 2010</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">Brilliant engine building Euro with a strong theme overlay. Uses Kim Stanley Robinson's series of Mars books as a jump off point.  I'll play anyday.</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="Brazil">Excelent game. It really feels into the theme and is different from every game I played before. Of course a lot of mechanics are familiar to me, but it really feels unique. The interaction with other players exists, but is not all that big. It focus a lot on the cards and synergy with the company chosen combined with some standard projects and actions. Great solo experience!</comment>

    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">We have played this 3 times now...and are looking forward to more games ahead. So far, with 1, 2, and 3 players...looking forward to 4 and 5 player games soon.  EXCELLENT balance of resource management, cooperative play, and competitive play, combined with an extremely popular theme (terraforming Mars) and heavily researched science sprinkled with fun. We love it!  It really gives the feel of the game's theme and inspires. Thanks!!</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">This might challenge Roll for the Galaxy: Ambition as my fave...</comment>
    <comment game="Terraforming Mars" game_id="167791" location="United States">It feels like you really terraforming Mars. If you new in resource management, the game teaches you a lot. My two first plays were pretty frustrating in terms of trying to win at my wonderful partner who's a guru of resource management. So, if you're ready to grow spiritually and professionally, this game is for you. Don't trust those who writes that it takes two hours. To enjoy, think and made decisions, 3 hours is a minimum. Highly recommend!</comment>

Players more or less get to develop their own tableau without the need to worry about other player interfering with their plans.  Overall a great game but one I don't feel compelled to own.</comment>

    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="United Kingdom">This gem gets better and better. Multiple paths to victory, a brain burny worker placement system, some setup randomization, asymmetrical starting resources, brilliant art design and theme (if a little pasted) - pure Euro at its finest</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Romania">This is a solid worker placement game with a time management twist and a very well designed board.   It has high replay value and a rather high addiction factor for this type of game: once set on the table you just want to play it over and over again. This is possible because it plays very fast once you know how to handle it.  Add the expansion and you'll have a mind-blowing experience. (Endless possibilities, and a very competitive game ... in the same short time.)</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="">[With the expansion]  I think this is my favorite worker placement game.  It's attractive and the mechanics are both unique and intuitive enough to learn quickly and remember without large time spent re-learning rules.  Nice features:  it's not just solitaire, but not passive-aggressive cruelty, like most worker placement.  You may chance your opponent's plans, but usually won't just take the thing they needed above all else.  Starting player management is actually interesting and fun, rather than an annoying aspect.  Variable setup makes it play different, and most paths are potentially viable.</comment>
    <comment game="Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar" game_id="126163" location="Greece">Do you know Caylus? Well, meet his grandson Tzolkin! Most of the elements that made Caylus one of the best games plus the introduction of time with the moving gears on the board! Awesome! If you like this game consider including the expansion as it makes it even more interesting!</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="">Just amazing... If you like role playing games and you don't have time to play anymore, you will like this game. I thought it was a little bit expensive when I bought it (because of the expansions price) but it's really worth the price!  Now, I just think about buying the expansion and having a new session to play it...</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Sweden">Very immersive game. Its more of a RPG than a boardgame. Great first adventure, "the Asylum" had two great puzzels. It&#180;s the game that Mansions of Madness wanted to be like but never was.  You can never play the core box mission more than one time, when you solve it you have to move on to the next expansion mission. So I guess this game is a bit more expensive than a normal boardgame.  Can&#180;wait to play the next mission, The Macy case. </comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Time stories is a definition 10 for me. It is incredibly fun, interesting, innovative, and offers me a gaming experience I cannot get elsewhere. That being said, Asylum was a masterpiece and I really did not much like Marcy Case. This review is more for the system than an individual story though, and I am very excited to watch the system evolve.</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">My only 10 rated game. Really love this game. Great game that is: fun, thematic, co-op, a puzzle, and an exploration game all-in-one.  It may be a one off, but some of the most fun I have had in a game and it was worth every cent. I will happily buy every expansion. Make more scenarios!</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Germany">One of the very best games I know! A brilliant concept, very exciting. The TIME flies while you play. The truly fascinating thing is how the plot develops and how you investigate piece by piece until the complex story unravels. It feels like living an episode of "Dr Who" trying to intervene in one of "Sherlock"'s cases.  If you love theme based games that tell a story above all, you will not find any  better. It is also a good way of introducing people to the concept of role play because it works in a similar way as far as the activities of the players are concerned.  If you do not like role play and prefer more regular board games on the eurogame side, you should not buy it.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="Canada">Really quite enjoyed the base story and look forward to playing more.  It's a shame, though natural, that something so well thought out is also so limited, but I'll take what I can get and draw it out~</comment>

    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">I have never in my life played a game like this. It's a dash of roleplaying, a ton of story telling and a simply AMAZING puzzle to be solved. Each case can only be played through once so replayability is certainly a factor to consider, especially for the price. That said it really is an amazing experience and my group considers it as being completely worth while.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">An innovative system that gives out what is put in. Get some drinks and good friends and delve into a plot. The mechanics provide obstacles as well as tools to cause disucssion, disagreement, and humor. While the original story is very simple, it is a tutorial at heart. Later scenarios massively push new ideas and styles and the game doesn't struggle under the weight. The game costs quite a bit, but for four friends, it is cheaper than a movie and you watch a different version of the movie two or three times. I have since introduced it to new players and have had fun replaying it and watching them work through it, while I acted as a sort-of DM. Another 12+ hours on those cheap movie tickets. The quality of the game will depend on the scenarios, and there are some very good ones now available.</comment>
    <comment game="T.I.M.E Stories" game_id="146508" location="United States">Multi-player point and click adventure with role-playing and puzzle solving and a real need for communication, debate, and consensus -- pure brilliance!!  My highest rating possible, cannot believe how fun and wide open the system is for endless genres of puzzles and adventure!!</comment>

    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Scotland">My favourite game.  Scales well to all player counts and includes engine building, worker placement, auction and tile laying seamlessly.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">If I had invented a game, I wish it were this one. The game mechanic is relatively simple to teach quickly yet has enough depth to avoid "solving." Randomization in setup eliminates carbon-copy repeats of games, but it doesn't cancel planning (unlike See: Pirate's Cove). You have to plan ahead somewhat, but the inherent randomization in setup means you can't plan too far ahead (cuts down on analysis-paralysis; see: Agricola). You can almost always do something (if you have the workers for it), even if it costs you more (little blocking out; see: Agricola). Basically, everything that I *don't* like about Agricola is fixed by Keyflower. :-)</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Brilliant. A little meaner than my wife and I typically are in the mood for, so it doesn't see the table as often as it might, but its as sharp as a razor.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">I really enjoy this game. The strategy is good but not punishing as it allows you to relocate bids that are losing bets to other tiles for another bid OR production purposes. I think of this as lords of Waterdeep meets Carcassonne, but a touch more involved on both fronts.</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="Poland">Best Worker Placement Ever!</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Favorite</comment>
    <comment game="Keyflower" game_id="122515" location="United States">Includes: [thing=163572][/thing] [thing=180037][/thing]  Keyflower is a wonderful mix of all of my favorite Euro mechanisms. You get to manage a giant heap of meeples, auction tiles, build your own village, toss folks out onto the various boards as either currency or through worker placement, and watch as cute little ships arrive from the Old Country filled with the tools and workforce eager to help you settle North America for the first time!  Juliet Breese's artwork is beyond compare--I would wallpaper my house with the stuff. The components are fantastic (unique cottage player screens, tons of barrels and meeples, thick, concise hexes), the game is deeply centered around personal objectives and engine building, and it is [i]crazy[/i] interactive for a Euro. There is a great deal of worker placement blocking, auction denial, priority backstabbing, and genuine grounds for trash talking about horses and buggies. What's not to love here?  I could play this and only this for the rest of my life. It scales amazingly well from 2-6 players, the tiles don't get old, and the various interactions between the individual mechanics are timeless.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">I love the fact that you can play this game in 30-40 minutes and feel like you played a full strategy game. While it won't replace our big strategy games, this will hit the table on those days when we only have an hour to play games. Great game!</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">Played with 3, 5, and 6 players.  Great fun every time.   Easy to learn, fast to teach.  Highly recommended as a  strategy game.  Best with 4+ players.  </comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">Great game with any number of players 4-7. Really good for new people to board gaming even with the large amount of rules. Very easy to learn and to play. </comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="United States">I admit this one is growing on me. I wasn't sure what to think of it the first dozen or so times we played it. I guess I expected more than a card game - more chits, more stuff to move. But there are a lot of things to like here. The downtime is zero; everyone plays at the same time. This also means the game can scale between 2 players and 7-8 players easily without increasing the game time much, if at all. Also, the game does not outstay its welcome. It never lasts longer than 30-45 minutes, which allows you to play through multiple games in an evening.  We introduced the Leaders expansion recently and think it is a great addition to the base game.  6-1-14: Bumped it up to an 8. Easy to teach, quick to play, and scales up very well from 2 to 7 players.  10-3-14: 18 months ago when we first bought this game, I rated it as a 7. After playing it a few more times, I bumped it up to a 7.5. Then after a few more plays, bumped it to an 8. Then an 8.5. And now I've increased the rating to a 9. I can't think of another game I've increased its rating after playing it so many times. I've played lots of 2, 3 and 4 players games, as well as a few with 6 or 7. When everyone has had a few plays under their belt this is a very competitive, tight game.  7-13-16: Bumped to a 10. This is one of my favorite games.</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="China">its a short game...more people with fun,instead fewer people with a little strategy</comment>
    <comment game="7 Wonders" game_id="68448" location="">Highly competetive card game with simple rules but complex strategy. Rarely used draft mechanics allows for a lot of player interaction. Randomness vs. skill is well balanced.  Definitely many skill levels exist.  Plays fast (7-14 minutes online, 25-40 minutes in real life), with simple set up and clean up. Strategy and experience depends on number of players (personally prefer 2-4 players).  Still feels fun and fresh after 5000 games.  Amazing art on the cards. Highly recommend sleeving cards due to barely acceptable durability.  A masterpiece.</comment>

    <comment game="Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game" game_id="150376" location="United States">This game is amazing.  The stories you will get from this game will stick with you.  The crossroad cards are a great touch, and the tension that the crises bring is palpable.  Group make up will make or break this game, our group focuses on the main objective while also trying to complete the personal.  The consensus is a shared half win is better that a total loss, not all gamers are like this however.  Easily my favorite of 2014, and in my top 5 of all time.</comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Spain">Hmm. I would like to give this a 9 because my game preferences are getting heavier and this obviously is innovative and deep but it stays an 8 because it is beyond my strategic comprehension. I admire it tremendously but I can't get my head round how you win or even half the time how you go about trying to win.  Update: Spent one whole summer playing it. Now a 10. Absolutely brilliant. Whole provost/bailiff time management thing is intriguing. So much depth. Excellent with 2.</comment>

    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Hong Kong">Just the first game and can't say the rules are simple but love it! Corrected some misreadings and the second game was enjoyable.  Replayed the game after five years and so many different worker-placement games, must say that; "Caylus is still the loverly King of Worker-placement".</comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="Canada">I especially like how setting up the 6 neutral buildings randomly at the beginning of each game affects the whole flavour of each individual game. It contributes to a high replayability, high complexity for determining optimal strategies, without randomization. This is one of the reasons I think this one will be played for a long time. The rules were remarkably clear for a game this complex (2nd edition).  In my opinion, it has a similar feel than both puerto rico (production building cash victory points cycle) and in the shadow of the emperor (selecting opportune favors, trying to place "better" than other players in castle building in each turn, buying worker placement vs. buying elector placement).  After a weekend of playing, my initial impression is that I like it better for 2 players than 3. In a 2 against 1 scenario there is not much that can be done against the provost, so there it can possibly be frustrating at times. </comment>
    <comment game="Caylus" game_id="18602" location="United States">Caylus is my gateway game, no fooling! My profile (and number of plays) shows how much I love it. (Why has Caylus slipped from my #1? Just the fact that I don't play it often because it is not as engaging when you play with less enthusiastic players.) But there's nothing like it when you're in the mood for its lax theme and abstract economy!</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United Kingdom">Our favorite game of 2015. I knew I had to give this game a 10 when we couldn't stop playing, it's hugely compulsive.  Even yesterday we played 3 games one after the other (each lasting about 2 hours with 3 players and $800-900 in the reserve). I'm already looking forward to our next play.  There are so many options - in our very first game we found it slightly daunting and difficult to know which way to jump: there are a huge number of combinations of staff and milestones to consider. But one game is enough to give you a grasp on the roles available and the significance of the milestone bonuses.  The randomly generated map and the dynamic nature of the marketing campaigns and property development means you get a different game experience each time and opportunities to try out different strategies. But it is certainly the case that bad choices made in the first couple of turns could see you struggle for the whole rest of the game.  We removed the "First to $100" milestone bonus - it just seemed to turn the leader into a runaway leader.</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">[2-5] An incredible game that pushes the players to balance a wide range of processes (food production, marketing, networks, payroll, tech/training tree, discounting, etc) and really makes the brain burn! I love the art direction and the ways in which the mechanics are all in support of the larger thematic play. On our first day we played two introductory games followed by a full play. We loved it.   (1st ed. w/ upgraded rules and components)</comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United Kingdom">One of the best (the best?) Splotter games with so much to think about and consider. I loved it. Top 100 prediction.  Advice about starting a run through with no salaries and milestones is a good idea.</comment>

    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">Original and, potentially, brutal Euro.  This is definitely not multi-player solitaire.  The ramp up is gentle but once things get going, the competition takes off like a rocket.  Money will be disappearing left and right while you scramble to meet needs, gain an advantage over your competitors through clever marketing and hiring, and deploy new restaurants or homes.  Yes, the board is bland (but effective).  But the rest of the game design is quite clever.   It's a brilliant, highly original, and unforgiving game. </comment>
    <comment game="Food Chain Magnate" game_id="175914" location="United States">This game is absolutely fantastic. And deceptively simple. Your hire some dudes, and then you play these dudes in a tree-like fashion in order to get every ability they allow. And if your the first to get some of these abilities played, you get extra special abilities that will change the way you play. That's it.  But then this game is all about reacting to what your friends are doing to the game. There's so many different ways to win it all but it always adjusts depending on the state of the board and what cards everyone has access to. Because of this, you end up watching everyone one pretty intensely and your always engaged - but your never waiting for long because turns are really short.  Throughout the first play it was also fun to see people's faces around the table as they truly 'got' the meaning behind a lot of little rules that make a HUGE difference in how the game plays. It was like watching people's mind explode over and over again, and with each boom it was as if their excitement and appreciation for the game got higher and higher.  Suuuuuuch beautiful design. And now I understand the craze behind Splotter.</comment>

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="Brazil">This game is an euro with a lot of influences in the design, I identify influences from Troyes to Ticket to Ride and Bora Bora. A beautiful design with good theme, pasted, but decently. The art is beautiful and it is a very fast game for it's depth. The rules are easy to explain and the replayability is very high.

    <comment game="The Voyages of Marco Polo" game_id="171623" location="United States">Really hits the sweet spot for me: strategic, with good depth in a short playing time, and having a broad appeal. Lots of difficult decisions at every turn. The special character powers and the randomized set up take the game to a 10. Excellent replayability! Plays great at all player counts.   The components are lovely and really add to the enjoyment. I found that marking some pips on the 3-value goods was helpful. </comment>

    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Romania">Brilliant game. After 1 game it became my 2nd favorite game after Marvel Legendary. My girlfriend is not that fond of all the luck-dependency, though we both agree that it is cool that they've included so many possibilities to mitigate the luck-element. I've heard that the expansions solve that through the Focus action? Looking forward to playing it more and eventually getting all the expansions. Brilliant, brilliant design.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">This game is what I always wanted Arkham Horror to be.  It's still long, but very thematic - much more so than Arkham.  They are two different games still, but I'll always play this one over Arkham </comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">I love playing this game for its theme and adventure mechanics. i even enjoy playing Solo.  A must have for anyone who loves exploring and 20's Era Cathulu themes.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United Kingdom">Delivers a strong narrative with massive replay capability. Plays in a couple of hours with fairly simple rules and a reasonable footprint (YMMV of course).  The 'reckoning' effects are excellent. What at first may appear to be a fairly minor condition or even an asset can turn sour, in some cases starting a chain of further conditions and reckonings that given time and enough bad luck eventually spirals down to catastrophe.   The various encounter decks in the base game are quite limited and they're easy to burn through in a single session. However this is addressed by the Forsaken Lore expansion. </comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="Canada">Until Pandemic Legacy came, this was our defacto "Co-Op when we have 2-3 hours to spend in one sitting" Will get that position back once we've completed Legacy Season 1 (until they release Pandemic Legacy Season 2!)</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">My favorite board game by far. I like how there are ways to mitigate the randomness of the dice. Dedicated decks for each Ancient One mean each play is themed according to your chosen foe.  I especially love how it's less fiddly than Arkham Horror!</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">Fantastic game, and a nice mix of strategy and dice-rolling shenanigans.  Somewhat long, and does need the right group, but relatively intuitive and generally hilarious as long as people get into it at all.  Bonus points for being well-written - the Mythos is well-represented, the art is great, and the rulebook doesn't suck.  Only problem is that the research and location encounter decks are a bit spare, but Forsaken Lore more than fixes that.</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="">Completely replaced Arkham Horror for me. Starting to suffer a little bit from Expansion creep nowadays but another game where the theme really matters. Plus tentacles!</comment>
    <comment game="Eldritch Horror" game_id="146021" location="United States">Bought it, played it once, hated it, traded it.  Had a change of heart, bought it again, and now it's one of my favorite games.  Sometimes giving a game a second play can make all the difference.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">Simply Gorgeous.  And what I mean is that it is simple and elegant in its design and execution.  Took about 10 minutes to learn and 2 turns to fully grasp.  After that, a great time!  Played 5 times now!  No drop off because of the variability in set-up and subsequent strategy.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Spain">Very good game. I like all the rondel/Gerdts games that I have played. This does not have a rondel but is compiting with Imperial as the best Gerdts game.</comment>

    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="Netherlands">What an amazing game: Easy to teach, elegant, interactive, doesn't outstay its welcome. One of the only games I just want to keep playing no matter if I win or lose.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United Kingdom">Elegant, beautifully themed euro about trading in the Mediterranean, Roman-style. A handful of diverse but simple mechanics fit together smoothly and thematically. There are many routes to victory, and a delicious tension between expanding your trade empire (your goods-producing engine) and acquiring cards that dictate both how you'll score points and the flexibility of your actions. There's no direct conflict, but a great deal of interaction comes from the race for cities and rivalry over buying cards. The variable assignment of bonus tiles to provinces, variable location of cities, and order in which the cards come out of the draw deck means every new play is fresh.</comment>
    <comment game="Concordia" game_id="124361" location="United States">Concordia is probably tied with Puerto Rico as being my favorite game ever.  It's so elegantly designed that anyone can just start playing while the depth adds a ton of replay value and interesting decisions to make.  Also the game feels very balanced and any mistakes in play are clearly recognizable and analyzed.</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">This is the game of all strategy games. It truly doesn't get any better than this! There's politics, technology advances, threats, warfare, back stabbing...everything you could hope for. Its only downside is that it takes six plus hours to play and it is tough to find people willing to sit down for that long to play. Best game ever!</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="Germany">Great components and a nice epic gameplay, which is more influenced by diplomatic discussions than by pure warfare. I think it is best with the maximum number of players, because otherwise there is not enough reason for war, when everyone has enough resources. My only real complaint about the basegame is the broken Imperial-Strategy Card, that should really be exchanged with the one form the Add-On.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">If you're committed to the play time, the depth of this game, and realize the potential repercussions of each action on the endgame, the effect is awe inspiring.  Throughout my first play, I kept thinking to myself "wow, there is so much to this game, and it would take a long time to truly master it".  Our group had committed 10 hours to our first play (it only took about 8, with only 6 of actual play time), and by the time it was over, many of us were sad that it had ended so soon!  I think preparation for what we were getting into, really helped with our initial attitude.  The first time you play, it's really long.  There's a lot of explanation and setup involved.  However, were we to play with the same players, that time would probably be cut down dramatically.  I imagine we could get through a game in 6 hours with 8 players.  I CANNOT wait to own this game for myself!  One other thing, it seems the Shattered Empire expansion pretty much bumps the awesomeness rating of this up several notches.  So you may be doing yourself a disservice by playing the game without it.</comment>

    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">Twilight Imperium. What else is there to say about the greatest board game ever made? There is only one game that I am always willing to play, assuming I have the time, and it is this one.  I grew up around science fiction and, in particular, Star Wars. And Twilight Imperium perfectly captures the kind of sweeping, cosmic narrative that I loved as a kid&#8212;no other board game creates stories like this one, with clever diplomacy, trade, bribery and political intrigue, massive battles, and broken alliances.  Technically the base game has a couple of minor flaws, but Shattered Empire neatly resolves them and adds a ton of interesting content. Shards of the Throne is in many ways a weak expansion, but certain modules (Representatives in particular) add even more depth and interesting stories to the game. I play with most of both expansions and wouldn't go back.  (4X / civilization; 2x)</comment>
    <comment game="Twilight Imperium (Third Edition)" game_id="12493" location="United States">My favorite game. This is what I really wanted Axis &amp; Allies to be, all those fun nights as a teen-ager.  Probably going to be my favorite for a very long time!</comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="United Kingdom">I have found the perfect game, Dominant Species. Simple to teach and play, no rules issues, constant player interaction and really tough decisions all the way through. also works from 2 through to 6 players. After every game you are left with so many after thoughts of, could have, should have and will do. No perfect strategies and constant evolving plans. the game is thematic and emotive too. A 10 out of 10 from me.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Scotland">Brutal worker placement that is wonderfully layered and deep game play.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Wales">The best heavyweight game I have played. Our four player run took 3.5 hours and everyone played quickly with little distraction. The theme is great - the mechanics work well together, but as with all long games, it is a real drawn out affair if you are so far behind in the mid-game that you have no real hope of catching up.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Romania">A very good mix of mechanics that leads to very complex and subtle layers of interaction between players. Unlike anything I've seen so far.   It's a long game but it's definitely worth the time.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Sweden">Really like the mechanics in this game and I have really fun when I play it. The interaction with other players is fantastic and the assymetrical races adds an interesting layer to the game.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Spain">Bad production (for eurogame standards), ugly but functional board and tiles (I have the first edition). Unique double majority control system. Nice, diverse and deep gameplay, very susceptible to kingmaking. I have played it with 2, 4, 5 and 6 and I liked it in every configuration, but it can get too long (a full game can be very satisfying, but often I would prefer to reduce the number of cards and initial cubes for a shorter game). </comment>

    <comment game="Dominant Species" game_id="62219" location="Singapore">One of the best recent eurogame designs that incooperates elements of Civilization, Wargaming and 'settlers-of-catan's' way of presentation. In some way, this game does give a nostalgic feel towards an old game....Tyranno Ex.   No dice, no CRT charts, no chit-pull on who goes first......  An excellent game design that is clean, unlimited replayability, player interactions and multi-facet strategy to winning.  Downtime is minimal till last 1 or 2 turns but is acceptable.  With this game, El Grande looks like child's play.  A game that I will be playing for years to come.......awesome, just awesome.</comment>

    <comment game="El Grande" game_id="93" location="Finland">2007/XX/XX: I'm not a big fan of this game but will play if someone lays it on the table.  Edit 2010/5/13: Played again after many years and I had to raise the rating from 6 -&gt; 8. Maybe I wasn't ready for El Grande when I first tried it a few years ago. This must mean that I've grown as a boardgamer. Especially I've grown into area control games.  2013/01 8-&gt;9 Just great. El Grande has developed into a solid favourite of mine and I'm always in a mood for playing it. This clearly satisfies the criteria for a 9  2016/04 9-&gt;10 It is really astonishing how a game I initially perceived as dry has revealed so much depth and flavour over the years. Every single decision feels infinitely important and there are no dead moments in the game. Upon almost every move you have to choose whether you want to capitalise the potential immediately or build up your position for later rounds, and all actions have an impact on your opponents. Thus, the playing time of approx. 90 minutes with 4-5 players is packed full of excitement.  However, it is easy to see why El Grande is not to everyone's tastes. The game is very confrontational with a lot of in-your-face moments. It is also rather chaotic since you have very little control over other players. Thus it is crucial to tolerate a constant feel of insecurity and uncertainty. But this is not to say that the game is random. Actually it is far from it.  I must admit that at today's standards the game does not look very appealing and mechanically it is very simple. But even with this simple set of rules you find yourself agonising over your decisions. Not because the decision tree would be too big but for the trade-offs you have to take.  If there is something to really criticise about El Grande it would be the fact that the game plays well only with 4-5 players the optimum being 5. With fewer players you usually end up in a situation where the game is decided at the very moment when two players start fighting. In this case the third player usually claims the prize. Moreover, in really tight games you can have king making situations. Personally I have come to tolerate this and don't feel sorry for losing if it was due to a kingmaker because I know I played well.  In a nutshell, El Grande should be used as an example of a reasonably fast playing game in which every move is significant. </comment>

    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Finland">One of my favourite games of all time. Absolutely brilliant. Elegant design, fast and immensely fun to play. Works well with many different player counts and is very portable - a must game to take with you anywhere!  I first rated it 10, but later took the rating down a notch as the base game gets a bit dry after dozens of plays and once you learn it, the Consume-Produce strategy is the surefire way to go. The base game alone thus falls a bit short of the absolute perfection that is required of a 10.. I'd still give it [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC99][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]9.5[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC99]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size]  Expansions have added immensly to the game, however. The first one is great, the second one too, and the third one adds some very interesting cards to the mix.  However, the prestige rules of the third expansion completely break the game. They're so awful I never play with them anymore and have removed the cards and goals that deal with them from the game. The only things I use from the 3rd expasion are 3 start worlds, 1 goal and 28 cards. The deck is starting to get somewhat unwieldy after three expansions in any case.  Played with the best parts of the expansions (or even with just the first expansion), I simply cannot give the game anything but a [size=14][BGCOLOR=#00CC00][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=2][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][size=8][b]10[/b][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/size][COLOR=#00CC00]_[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/size]  Keldon's AI (available online for free) is incredible and a great way to play the game against AI opponents. Helps tremendously in learning to play the game competitively too. I have probably around 1000 plays against the AI (I don't log these) and still never grow tired of playing this game. </comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">I'm drawn to this again and again, yet don't fully appreciate the game. Have only played it solitaire, and that may indeed be a factor. The robot in the expansion is formidable, having won roughly 80%-90% of all games played... so it does appear to be quite the challenge to defeat.  I'm experimenting with several other solo options for this game -- those posted here on BGG are very good. They're more fun than the clobbering I endure at the hand of the robot, that's for sure.  ;)  UPDATE: I consider myself very well experienced with this title at this point, and it's one of the finer titles in my collection. It's full of interesting decisions that matter, a short playing time, and the desire to say, "Let's do that again!" </comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United Kingdom">Possibly the most fun you can have in the least amount of minutes in 2 player form. Without a doubt hard to learn (see San Juan below as a way to get your head around the basic mechanics before proceeding directly to takeovers in the 3rd expansion!). A wonderful 2 player game and the expansions only add more layers without unbalancing it (though the 3rd expansion does change the game). FYI - My gf normally wipes the floor with me at this game. :-(  EDIT - Upgraded the game to a 10 after first few multi player games Jan 2012.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Sweden">One of the best games ever made. Sure, it's a bit solitare, but it's a game with a lot of variety (with the expansions) and it's by far me and my wifes favorite game, once we grasped all the iconography, and there's a lot of symbols going on...   Best game ever, sofar, period, fur us...  Oh, and we prefered to remove prestige and goals and remove some cards from the expansions, since the basic game mechanic is already great enough (less is more according to us)</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="United States">Great game that offers a ton of strategy and tactics.  The symbols are a necessary evil to condense such a complex game into 20 minutes.  There are times where luck can swing real hard in a player's favor, but it's not too bad.</comment>
    <comment game="Race for the Galaxy" game_id="28143" location="Brazil">Que de jogo complicado de aprender e ensinar!

    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="">Without a doubt one of the best games I own, including the sister game and all add-ons. This game has a simple basic rule-set but the cards provide variety. While other games have variety from game to game, Dominion almost seems like a different game every time you play. Critical thinking skills are both demanded and exercised by this game. The wording on the cards is clear and precise and requires players to have similar thinking to play. I generally use this game as a litmus test to see if others can think precisely, cleverly and deviously (as opposed to thinking fuzzy and using language lazily).</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="United States">I don't think this should be considered a game in its own right, even though it comes with money and victory cards, since the designer didn't. Favorite cards: Baron, Upgrade, Conspirator.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion: Intrigue" game_id="40834" location="Wales">A little nastier than the other expansions - more attacks which doesn't go down well in games with my girlfriend. But another good set providing more variety again. I also enjoy the 5/6 player game, even though it adds significantly to downtime and playing time.</comment>

    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">[b]aaj's favorite REVERSE WORKER PLACEMENT[/b] It's hard to believe that Five Tribes is only two years old. This game burst onto my personal scene with a vengeance, and I'd have to class it as my favorite game right now (I've played the game probably 5-6 times, but only recently started logging plays). in Five Tribes, you will use a reverse worker placement mechanic smooshed with mancala to pick up meeples off the board and use their abilities. Meeples can buy you goods, help you court the favor of powerful genies, assassinate other meeples, and earn you victory points towards the game end.   Five Tribes is an incredibly tight, tactical game. Every turn, you will be scoping out the game board for the best possible turn, and then bidding on the turn order (which brings in some nice bluffing and planning -- it's possible to entirely overbid as happened to one player in the latest game we played). Because of this, it can be prone to AP, but this doesn't happen often if you keep players moving.   I love Five Tribes because it presents so many difficult decisions as well as so many paths to victory. I sprinted to a tight win in our latest game because I specialized on the market almost to the exclusion of everything else. I've seen other players win with Djinns, with conservative bidding, and with great area control on the board. The great part is, you need to focus on multiple victory point engines in addition to your primary one, because one specialty won't be enough to bring you to victory.   If you love tactical games, beautiful artwork, and a great, elegant game that plays in under an hour and a half, Five Tribes is for you. I couldn't think of another game that better uses worker placement in such an innovative fashion, and it's one of my go-tos when we want a medium-heavy game to play. Highly, highly recommended.  [b]Expansions Owned[/b] [thing=176677][/thing] [b][BGCOLOR=#00CC00][COLOR=#00cc00].[/COLOR]10[COLOR=#00cc00].[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR][/b] - the best way to expand a game. New mechanics are introduced, but they aren't ridiculously overpowered and don't add needless complexity. With the exception of teaching newbies, I think I'll always play with the expansion since it feels so . . . natural. It adds a bigger game board, with a few obstacles (mountains and the void), and the Artisans are a great sixth tribe. Adding the magical items to the base game works out well as well, and it can really be a viable path to victory.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">Love the look, the mechanics, and yes I like the theme too. AP players should probably avoid it though. Love it. </comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">I purchased this game as soon as it came out, have played it about 10 times and can't get enough.  Absolutely my favorite game now and I hope to play it many more times.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="Netherlands">If this is not THE best game out there, it is at the very least easily my favourite. Lots of roads to victory, many decisions to make and a very, very original game (with superb components) make this a must buy. Also, you get two games for the price of one, really, since the two player game is so very different from the 3/4 player game. And I love both tremendously.</comment>
    <comment game="Five Tribes" game_id="157354" location="United States">People have described it as Mancala with new rules, but I can't do that.  The gameplay is similar in terms of you pick things up and drop them, but it isn't similar anymore after that.  I love the mechanics, I love the scoring and I love the Djinns!  I've taught my mom (non-gamer), my dad (gamer), my wife (gateway gamer) and a few of my friends it.  It has yet to be declined by any of them and after the first game, they all wanted to immediately play it again.  I love games with easy rules, quick turns and the non-solitaire feel.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="Germany">I was surprised how fun I had. The realy big problem is: You must buy many little expansion to add the full possibilities. I'm one of these guys who think: the dice have no more influence, as the list and player skill. I rate the game including the influence of the wave one, two and three. NOTE: After a bunch of games and wave four - I rate it 10...</comment>

    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="Poland">Fast pretty and simple, with surprising depth.  I always wanted some ships as a collector but was really surprised how good the game is. My only gripe against it is bad (from gamer perspective) supporting card packaging. Cards that suplement your ships are most often in packages with completely different ships (good for company business bad for end users). But if you are non-tournament player just forget about the cards and print the rules from the net.  Its worth it.</comment>
    <comment game="Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" game_id="103885" location="United Kingdom">Best "dog Fight" game on the market, AND it's Star Wars.  I don't see how it gets better  Oh and the models whilst expensive are SUPERB.</comment>

    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="">The gateway game to worker placement games. It doesn't get simpler but still really enjoyable. Theme pars okay depending on the group. Played the shit out of it</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Canada">My favourite worker placement game because it maintains theme and puts those around just the most solid worker placement mechanics I've seen in any game.</comment>
    <comment game="Lords of Waterdeep" game_id="110327" location="Romania">IMHO the best mix between fantasy and worker placement games. You don't have to have read or played anything in the Forgotten Realms universe. The idea I like the most is that you are a manager of adventureres, you have to hire rogues, mages, clerics and warriors in order to fulfill quests. I am the only one I know that reads the flavor text on the quests, it is a plus for the ones familiar with the universe...and doesn't affect the others or the game play. I played it over 20 times, even though I have the expansion, we never felt that we had enough of the base game. The thing I like most is that was easily accepted by all people in our group... no one disliked it and it is always the group's first choice. I rate it 10 because of that. </comment>

    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">As the one most often taking the role of Keeper in the first edition, the app makes this version fantastic. The immersion in the investigation is fantastic.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="">The app improves the game 100%, and the original was great fun too. The stories are so much fun and very immersive. Managing the game through the app is incredible and not gimmicky at all; I cannot say enough how great it is.</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">I love this game. The stories, the monsters, the difficulty- everything about it. We've lost more than we've won and I'm still always excited to egt it off the shelf and bust it out!</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">Absolutely loved the updates. Makes it faster to start and more enjoyable to play!</comment>
    <comment game="Mansions of Madness: Second Edition" game_id="205059" location="United States">Thankfully this doesn't feel like a digital board game or a video game.  This is most definitely a board game- it feels completely like a board game, it's just streamlined by the app.  A big step up from the original edition just because it's simpler and cleaner and you don't need a DM/keeper.  And it doesn't sacrifice any fun and atmosphere.  Really unique amongst board games, for those reasons and for the great story which is a rarity in board games.  Although this isn't the first game to use an app, it's exciting because it really is a new way to play there's a lot of potential other app assisted games.</comment>

    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Germany">Despite never having watched a single episode of the show, I took to this right away. It's my current "can't wait to play this again" hotness-of-the-moment game.  Update: I have now started watching the show because I enjoyed the game so much. Now I get what all the hype was about :) Still loving the game, too.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Australia">An excellent semi-cooperative, oozing with theme, and full of delicious betrayal &amp; deceit. My one complaint is that the game depends too much on the Crisis deck from my liking - constantly drawing Cylon attacks/no jump cards massively disadvantages the humans, while never drawing a Cylon attack card hurts the Cylon very hard.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Slovenia">Can be long, however it can be EPIC and it generates great story lines</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Hong Kong">Attracted by the TV series (both old and new ones) as well as the game's setting, though still waiting for suitable group to play the first game.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Germany">Another favourite game of mine, where the players slip into the personas of Adama, Starbuck, Apollo and many more. Loyalty cards define if you are a hidden agent of the cylons as there are models now thast look completely human.  The human struggle against crisis hammering on the fleet and dwindling resources require a lot of communication and strategy to be able to overcome the obstacles that are being given each turn.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Turkey">Vanilla : Best game I've played in its genre. Played like 50+ games and still discovering new tricks every game : )   Expansions: Not that good.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Canada">My favorite game. Awesome transposition of the series, with just the right amount of tactical and strategic choices. So much atmosphere and tension. Amazing replayability by itself, and with its 3 modular expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="Battlestar Galactica" game_id="37111" location="Canada">Favourite social interaction/semi cooperative game. The game itself is tight which puts pressure on the traitors.   Pegasus, CFB, new treachery, all characters, no extra loyalty for execution but titles pass before new character comes back.  5p or 6 w/mutineer</comment>

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">This is now my favorite 2 player game to play with my wife.  All the depth of Agricola without the frustration.  Though it lacks the "replayability" mechanism of the occupation/minor improvement cards, so far we've had a blast.  The competition for roles is not as cutthroat and you never feel like you've been cut off at the knees, something that has rather unpleasant consequences when playing with your SO!</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="El Salvador">Better than Le Havre! you always have the feeling that you won't acomplish everything you want with so few actions during the game. (36 actions in total) but you have so many choices every time that the real challange is to create the synergy with each actions to maximize the points at the end of the game...did i mention that this game is beautiful as well?</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">Probably Uwe Rosenberg's most brilliant game, but I still prefer the tension and professions in Agricola. Like Caverna, played solo it's ultimately a puzzle with a perfect solution somewhere out there.  </comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="Canada">Currently my favorite Uwe game. Wide open decision space with tons of replayability driven by the subselection of buildings. Recommended if you're a fan of worker placement games, particularly those in Uwe's farming cycle.</comment>

    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">2 player only</comment>
    <comment game="Fields of Arle" game_id="159675" location="United States">Great game, even solo.  There is only one rule change in the solo version so it plays very easily if you've played with two players.  Like Rosenberg's other games, it's a constant struggle for the resources to end the rounds without taking negative points at the same time as accomplishing all of your goals for the round.  I really enjoy the mechanic which allows you to upgrade your tools allowing you to complete more and more as the game goes on without having to feed more faces like you do in Agricola, Caverna, etc.  Highly recommended if you enjoy Rosenberg's style of tense, strategic euro gaming.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Canada">One of my favorite games. An amazingly simple set of mechanisms makes for an amazingly addictive and enjoyable experience. Just in the base set alone there is a ton of variety in the card types and abilities. One of the best parts of Dominion is the way I can custom tailor my deck to my play style and try to shoot for victory in my own way. Dominion is the ultimate game that fits under the banner of "easy for inexperienced players to understand, but massive depth to explore for experienced players". </comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="Canada">Didn't expect to like it, at all.  I was barely willing to play it when a friend brought it over.  But I love, love, love it!!!  Bought it the next day.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Very nice simple rules but so much game play as you can play this game so many ways.  My two game were so much different.  Played the suggested first game setup and then played the Big Money which was totally different.  Wow.  More plays in my future.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">The beginning of the deck building game idea.  Dominion is the oldest and still the best.  And you can literally play this game and never have the same experience.  Well worth buying it and the expansions.</comment>
    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">After the played the base set a number of times, I became a bit disappointed in the game. Certainly that it established a wildly popular new genre of board game is noteworthy, but it also quickly feels like a very generic instance of the genre, particular as new games have built on it. Further, I was worried that, once the 10 card spread has been picked, a suitably experienced player would know their strategy immediately and just go through the motions.   Then some friends asked me over to play the game with all of the expansions (except Alchemy, which we all agree bogs the game down). With the addition of Prosperity, suddenly this game had real depth, and I became hooked. The additions of Colonies (10 pt VP cards) and Platinums ($5), each game has a broad spectrum of decisions to make.</comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Dominion is one of my favorite strategy games out there.  It's well-thought out, with great gameplay dynamics, and many possible variations in play.  I love that strategies can significantly change with a few changes in cards from game-to-game.   Normally, card-oriented games tend to have a significant luck element, but Dominion is close to pure skill.  You really have to think about your actions, what sort of cards you are taking, how the cards work in relation to one another, what cards your opponents are taking, and how you can deal with difficult cards (such as "The Witch" and "The Thief").   I'd rank this #1 of the main Spiel des Jahres award winners that I've played. </comment>

    <comment game="Dominion" game_id="36218" location="United States">Deck Builder, Competitive, Medieval  This is a complex game where all players start with the same small deck of cards and purchase new cards with unique effects from a pool of cards determined randomly at the beginning of the game. Complexity level varies but skilled players can construct strategies and combos similar to any TCG, it's a blast. The game ends when 3 different "resource" piles have been depleted, or the highest valued "victory point" card has been depleted.   This is by far my favorite boardgame and the best one I have ever played. </comment>

    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="">This is one of those games that I think that has nothing in particular stand-out about it in terms of mechanics, but is nonetheless awesome.

    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">After having a great experience with Lords of Waterdeep, I was looking for the next great worker placement game to add to my collection. After just a few plays, I can already tell that Viticulture is just that. The game strikes a great balance between brainy and breezy; while it may not be the best WP game to introduce new gamers to, it's definitely not too overwhelming. The theme is very well-integrated, too. As you play, you can't help but feel just that much more classy as you're filling wine orders, upgrading your vineyard, and giving tours to wealthy and helpful visitors. The seasons mechanic definitely adds a strategic dynamic to the game, as you're forced to think steps ahead. If you're looking for a great "next step" WP that isn't as complex as, say, Agricola, I definitely recommend Viticulture.</comment>
    <comment game="Viticulture Essential Edition" game_id="183394" location="United States">This is my 10. I hope to only ever rate games based on this being a 10, Seasons being a 0 and Smash Up being a 5. To me, this is a perfect game. The slow start ramping up to an exciting (and frequently close) ending...this is why I am here. I take suggestions based on this title (though I like a lot of variety.)</comment>
